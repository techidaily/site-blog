In this article, we’ll talk about the essential factors involved in data migration of two devices with different operating systems. We will also provide a few tutorials on how to **transfer data from Vivo S17t to iPhone 15** conveniently. Continue reading below to learn more.


## Factors to Consider When Transferring Data From Vivo S17t to iPhone

It’s probably true to say that data migration is a major procedure. It’s not just a simple file-sharing method that can be completed in no time. A lot of things are involved when data is transferred from one device to another. To help you understand it better, below is a list of factors affecting the quality and speed of data migration.

### File Size

The size of files being transferred affects the process in general. This is because the Vivo S17t device on the receiving end needs to allocate the data individually to the available space. That’s why the procedure often takes some time to complete if the volume of files is quite large. On the hand one hand, data migration gets completed in a snap if the file size is smaller.

### File Type

The type of files involved in the data transfer is also a factor. Why so? The simplest explanation is that compatibility matters a lot in any form of file transfer. For instance, the procedure will likely fail if the receiver’s device does not support the data you’re trying to send. But don’t worry. There are lots of methods to transfer data from Vivo S17t to iPhone 15 if your first try doesn’t work out.

### Device Storage

Device storage is definitely the first thing you should check before going ahead with the data transfer. It is important that the receiver’s device has adequate memory to accommodate the incoming files. Otherwise, the transfer will likely not push through.

### Operating Systems

Migrating files between two smartphones with the same operating system is convenient. It’s because these two devices share an identical data-sharing structure. On the one hand, data migration between two smartphones with different operating systems is almost similar to the former. It’s just that the steps for the latter are quite longer. But don’t sweat it. There are many tutorials that can help you transfer data from Vivo S17t to iPhone 15 conveniently.

## Part 4. Mistakes to Avoid When Transferring Photos from Vivo S17t to iPad/iPhone

Transferring photos from your Vivo S17t to an iPad or iPhone holds the promise of seamless photo sharing. However, several factors can contribute to the failure of file transfer processes.

Overlooking available storage space on the iPad/iPhone is a common oversight. To avoid transfer failures, check and clear sufficient space on your iPad/iPhone to accommodate the photos you intend to transfer.

**3\. Interference from Third-Party Apps:**

Allowing interference from other apps during the transfer. Close unnecessary apps on both devices to prevent potential conflicts and ensure a smoother transfer process.

**4\. Ignoring file compatibility:**

Apple and Android devices often have varying file compatibilities. For example, iPhones commonly employ the HEIC format, which may pose recognition challenges on Android devices. So, verify that the photo formats are compatible with both Android and iOS devices. If necessary, convert files to ensure a trouble-free transfer.

**5\. Skipping App Permissions:**

When you use apps to transfer files, they usually ask for permission to access your media files. While it's common for users to overlook this step or hesitate to do it, not granting access can actually lead to transfer failures. The app needs permission to access and transfer files securely.

### Step 2: Connect Android and iOS Device

Next, you can connect your Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra and an iOS device to the computer (you can also use an Android device here). Use a USB cable for the Android device and a lightning cable for the iOS device. You'll get an interface like below when the program detects both devices. You can use the "Flip" button to change devices as the target device and the sender device. You can also choose the file types here to transfer.

### Step 3: Start Transfer Process

After choosing the desired file types (Photos for this case), click on the "Start Transfer" button to start the transfer process. Keep patience until the process ends and make sure both Android and iOS devices stay connected properly during the process.

### Step 4: Finish Transfer and Check

Within a short time, all your selected photos will be transferred to the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra. Then disconnect the Vivo S17t devices and check if everything is okay.

**Here is the video tutorial for you:**

**Important Note:** New Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra has new software to transfer all files to another device, called Smart switch. This feature is used for keeping the backup and restoring the files. Though it is good software, it has many cons. So, before using that app, check these cons.

- Smart Switch has a low-speed transfer problem. It shows up when you transfer data with wireless connectivity.
- After transferring the data, the smart switch does not back up the data. It is quite hard to recover the data using this app.
- Using the Smart Switch app, you can only transfer the data from Samsung to Samsung. You can't use it for other devices.

### Conclusion

Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra has amazing features for the bottom line and is more updated than other models. It has the best quality camera, better battery capacity, and other new features. The design and the display are way better than the other models. After purchasing the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra, if you get stuck transferring your photos to the Vivo S17t device, then you don't have to worry. We have introduced you to Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer in this article. Using this software, you can recover any files and keep data backup and restore them later. To transfer your photos to Galaxy S21 Ultra, you can use Dr.Fone Switch app by following the steps we provided. It's definitely better software than Smart Switch.
