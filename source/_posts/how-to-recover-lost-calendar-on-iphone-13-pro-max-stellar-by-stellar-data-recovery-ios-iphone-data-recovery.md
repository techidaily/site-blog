## How can I use a computer to check my storage?

You can check your iPhone’s storage using a computer with iTunes or Finder app installed.

![Resolve iPhone storage not loading and showing using the storage bar in iTunes](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/the-storage-bar-in-iTunes-1024x642.png)

## How can I fix iPhone Storage Not Loading/Showing?

### 1\. Wait a bit more

Some computing operations take a while to finish. Your phone’s storage may overflow with tons of app data, images, and other files if you’ve been using it for a while.

And each of them would have to load before reporting their combined size to the OS. Usually, loading takes about three minutes.

### 2\. Update iOS

If your iOS version was outdated, your phone’s functionalities, including storage access, would not function properly. Additionally, updating the OS will get rid of any potential issues. Follow the procedures listed below to check and update your iOS version:

- Select **General** from the **Settings** menu.
- Click on **Software Update**. If any updates are available, **download** and **install** them.

![Updating software to resolve iPhone storage not loading and showing ](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/software-update-process-1024x576.png)

### 3\. Force Stops the App

The settings app itself can be the problem due to an app bug. Therefore, forcing the app to close is a valid option. This will make the software restart from scratch, wiping off part of the data and information it had in RAM.

- Access the **app switcher** (swipe up your finger from the bottom of the screen to bring up the menu or double-click the **Home** button on older iPhone models).

![App switcher](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/App-switcher.png)

- Swipe up and drag the **Settings card** off the screen to force the app to close.
- Relaunch the **Settings app** to see if the problem persists.

### 4\. Reconnect to iCloud

iOS has been designed in a way that it needs to be connected to iCloud to function flawlessly. Therefore, the storage loading error could also be linked to connectivity issues between these two. In this case, signing out of the service and then back in again might resolve the issue.

- Open the **Settings** application.
- Click your profile at the top. To sign out of the service, tap **iCloud**.

![Reconnecting to iCloud settings to fix iPhone storage not loading and showing](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/iCloud-settings.png)

- Next, sign in once more using your **iCloud password**.

### 5\. Fix the Issue Using Your PC

When you connect the cable, link your iPhone to your PC, and sync the storage, iTunes looks for any issues and either fixes them on its own or recommends methods to fix them by yourself. For any software-related issues with your phone, this is a great fix, and it may even repair your iPhone storage not updating problem.

- Connect your phone to computers that have **iTunes** installed on them with a lightning cord.
- The storage data should be able to sync with your smartphone automatically.
- If not, press the **Sync** button.

### 6\. Factory Reset Your iPhone

You may fix any bugs that cause iPhone storage not to update by performing a factory reset. Furthermore, it would restore your OS version to its factory settings, resolving any problems that updates might have brought on.

The whole contents of your device will be deleted if you follow this method. You can either create a backup of your data or use a tool to restore it once your iPhone has been entirely deleted to prevent this.

- Go **Settings app** on your smartphone. Next, choose **Reset** after choosing **General**.
- Under Reset, among the few options, click **Erase all Content and Settings**.

![Earase All content to fix iPhone storage not loading and showing](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Erase-All-Content-and-Settings-option.png)

### Why isn’t my iPhone storage loading?

When trying to check your iPhone’s storage, you will notice a small spinning wheel going back and forth if your phone is having storage problems since it cannot accurately represent the amount of storage that is accessible.

Furthermore, the loading issue may show an incorrect amount of storage. Some users reported this and other minor issues throughout the iOS 15 beta testing phase. Other factors contributing to this issue include iCloud service problems and application bugs.

### Wrap up! Stellar is your ultimate backup
