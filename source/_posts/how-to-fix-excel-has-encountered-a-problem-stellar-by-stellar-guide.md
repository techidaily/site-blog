![Excel-cannot-open-this-file](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/Excel-cannot-open-this-file-img2.png)

## Why does Excel File turn Corrupt?

Following are some common reasons that can turn an Excel file corrupt:

- Large size of the Excel file
- The file is virus infected
- Hard drive on which Excel file is stored has developed bad sectors
- Abrupt system shutdown while working on a worksheet

## Workarounds to Recover Data from Corrupt Excel

The workarounds to recover corrupted Excel file 2016 data will vary depending on whether you can open the file or not.

How to Recover Corrupted Excel File 2016 Data When You Can Open the File?

If the corrupt Excel file is open, try any of the following workarounds to retrieve the data:

### **Workaround 1 – Use the Recover Unsaved Workbooks Option**

If your Excel file gets corrupt while you are working on it and you haven’t saved the changes, you can try retrieving the file’s data by following these steps:

- Open your Excel 2016 application and click on the **Open Other Workbooks** option.

![open-other-workbooks](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/open-other-workbooks-img3.png)

- Click the **Recover Unsaved Workbooks** button at the bottom of the ‘Recent Workbooks’ section.

![recover-unsaved-workbook](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/recover-unsaved-workbook-img4.png)

- A window with list of unsaved Excel files will open. Click the corrupt file you want to open.

This will reopen your last saved version of the Excel workbook. If this method doesn’t work, proceed with the next workaround.

### **Workaround 2 – Revert to Last Saved Version of your Excel File**

If your Excel file gets corrupt in the middle of making any changes, you can recover the file’s data if the changes haven’t been saved. For this, you need to revert to the last saved version of your Excel file. Doing so will discard any changes that may have caused the file to turn corrupt. Here’s how to do it:

- In your Excel 2016 file, click **File** from the main menu.
- Click **Open**. From the list of workbooks under Recent workbooks, double-click the corrupt workbook that is already open in Excel.
- Click **Yes** when prompted to reopen the workbook.

Excel will revert the corrupt file to its last saved version. If it fails, skip to the next workaround.

### **Workaround 3 – Save the Corrupted Excel File in Symbolic Link (SYLK) Format**

Saving an Excel file in SYLK format might help you filter out corrupted elements from the file. Here are the steps to do so:

- From your Excel **File** menu, choose **Save As**.
- In ‘Save As’ window that pops-up, from the **Save as type** dropdown list, choose the **SYLK (Symbolic Link)** option, and then click **Save**.

![symbolic link format](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/save-as-symbolic-link-format-img5.png)

**_Note:_** _Only the active sheet will be saved in workbook on choosing the SYLK format._

- Click **OK** when prompted that “The selected file type does not support workbooks that contain multiple sheets”. This will only save the active sheet.

![Workbooks contain multiple sheets warning msg](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/Workbooks-contain-multiple-sheets-warning-msg-img6.png)

- Click **Yes** when the warning message appears - “Some features in your workbook might be lost if you save it as SYLK (Symbolic Link)”.

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/Excel-message-img7.png)  

- Click **File** > **Open**.
- **Browse** the corrupt workbook saved with SYLK format (.slk) and open it.
- After opening the file, select **File** > **Save As**.
- In ‘Save as type’ dialog box, select Excel workbook.
- Rename the workbook and hit the **Save** button.

After performing these steps, a copy of your original workbook will be saved at the specified location.

How to Recover Corrupted Excel File 2016 Data When You Cannot Open the File?

If you can’t access the Excel file, apply one of these workarounds to salvage the file’s data.

### **Workaround 1 – Open and Repair the Excel File**

Excel automatically initiates ‘File Recovery’ mode on opening a corrupt file. After starting the auto-recovery mode, it attempts to reopen and repair the corrupt Excel file at the same time. If the auto-recovery mode does not start automatically, you can try to fix corrupted Excel file 2016 manually by using ‘Open and Repair’. Follow these steps:

- Open a blank file, click the **File** tab and select **Open**.
- **Browse** the location where the corrupt 2016 Excel file is stored.
- When an ‘Open’ dialog box appears, select the file you want to repair.
- Once the file is selected, click the arrow next to the **Open** button, and then click the **Open and Repair** button.
- Do any of these actions:
- Click **Repair** to fix corrupted file and recover data from it.
- Click **Extract Data** if you cannot repair the file or only need to extract values and formulas.

![repair excel file](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/repair-excel-file-img8.jpg)

If performing these actions doesn’t help you retrieve the data, proceed with the next workaround.

### **Workaround 2 – Disable the Protected View Settings**

Follow these steps to disable the protected view settings in an Excel file:

- Open a blank 2016 workbook.

![blank excel file](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/blank-excel-file-img9.png)

- Click the **File** tab and then select **Options**.

![Excel file options](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/Excel-file-options-img10.png)

- When an **Excel Options** window opens, click **Trust Center** > **Trust Center Settings.**

![open excel trust center settings](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/open-excel-trust-center-settings-img11.png)

- In the window that pops-up, choose **Protected View** from the left side navigation. Under ‘Protected View’, uncheck all the checkboxes, and then hit **OK**.

![disable-protected-view-settings](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/disable-protected-view-settings.png)

Now, try opening your corrupt Excel 2016 file. If it won’t open, try the next workaround.

### **Workaround 3 – Link to the Corrupt Excel File using External References**

If you only need to extract Excel file data without formulas or calculated values, use external references to link to your corrupt Excel 2016 file. Here’s how you can do it:

- From your Excel file, click **File** > **Open**.
- From the window that opens, click **Computer** and then click **Browse** and copy the name of your corrupt Excel 2016 file. Click the **Cancel** button.

![browse corrupted excel file](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/browse-corrupted-excel-file-img13.png)

- Go back to your Excel file, click **File** > **New** > **Blank workbook**.

![new excel workbook](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/new-excel-workbook-img14.png)

- In the new Excel workbook, type “=CorruptExcelFile Name!A1” in cell A1 to reference cell A1 of the corrupted file. Replace the ‘CorruptExcelFile Name’ with the name of the corrupt file that you have copied above. Hit **ENTER**.
- If ‘Update Values’ dialog box appears, select the corrupt 2016 Excel file, and then click **OK**.
- If ‘Select Sheet’ dialog box pops-up, select a corrupt sheet, and press the **OK** button.
- Select and drag cell A1 till the columns required to store the data of your corrupted Excel file.
- Next, copy **row A** and drag it down to the rows needed to save the file’s data.
- Select and copy the file’s data.
- From the **Edit** menu, choose the **Paste Special** option and then select **Values**. Click **OK** to paste values and remove the reference links to the corrupt file.

Check the new Excel file for recoverable data. If this didn’t work, consider using an [Excel file repair tool](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/) to retrieve data.

## How to Repair Excel Document on a Flash Drive

**Summary:** Microsoft Excel files are stored on flash drives if they need to be transferred between systems or if they need to be backed up. But sometimes unforeseen issues can corrupt the Excel sheets stored on flash drives. When that happens, it can be an arduous task to repair Excel documents on a flash drive. Through this post let us try to understand the reasons why Excel sheets stored on flash drives can get corrupted and how users can resolve them easily.

[![Free Download for Windows](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/free-download-windows.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/ "Free Download for Windows")

In this digital age, we all work with computers, files, and documents. Flash drives or USBs are common ways of storing data in an external place. Be it for a meeting or for a party playlist, these devices come handy when one wants to transfer data or access the files stored elsewhere.

You may need to access your data from another location. That’s when a USB flash drive might come in handy. And, that’s exactly why Excel sheets too end up on flash drives; either that or for backup purposes. However, there are many instances where an Excel file stored in a USB gets corrupted when one tries to access the file. The error message you get while trying to open the Excel file would be a great clue for figuring out the exact reason behind corruption.

This blog will provide insights into what are the reasons for the corruption of a USB and how the users can repair Excel on flash drive that has been corrupted.

## **Reasons for USB inaccessibility**

Sometimes flash drives or USBs can become unresponsive due to numerous reasons. There are two types of corruption – logical and physical. Physical corruptions occur due to broken stems and connectors, broken circuits, NAND gate, not recognised, RAW, need to format, not accessible, and dead drives (no power supply).

One of the main reasons behind such an error could be that the USB drive has been infected by some virus. This can affect any file – not only the ones which are there in the USB drive but also the ones which are there in the PC/Laptop where you connect the USB drive. It is recommended that you scan the USB drive with reliable antivirus software to detect viruses.

There can be various other reasons that may make your USB corrupt or unresponsive. But there are very slim chances that you will be able to recover a flash drive that has physical damage. However, you can try to run the check disk on the USB drive to fix the drive. We will be discussing this as you read on.

## **Recovery Methods for Corrupted Flash Drives**

There are 3 tried and tested recovery methods. Try them and see which one works out for you.

1. **Restoring Excel Files from Windows backup**

To bring back your old Excel files, fixing up the corrupt file is your best option. Importantly note that this method would work only if your system’s Windows backup option has been enabled.

**Step-by-step process for restoring your older Excel files:**

- Connect your USB drive
- Go to “My Computer”->USB Drive->Check if the file exists
- Right click on the excel file and click on the restore previous versions

![Restore Previous Versions](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/restore-previous-version-of-Excel.jpg)

- You will now see a list of older versions which were created
- Select one the backups and click on “restore”

2. **Using Command Line to Recover Excel Files**

In case you are looking to repair Excel on flash drive, you can also resolve it by using the command line. Just follow the below steps to see if you can recover the excel files.

- Connect your USB Flash drive
- Open “Run” (press Windows+R) and then open “cmd”

![Windows+R cmd](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/cmd.jpg)

- Type “attrib -h -r -s /s /d (USB Drive Letter):\\\*.\*” where the (USB Drive Letter) is the drive letter you can find using “My Computer”
- Once this has been completed, Windows will start repairing your files
- After the process gets over, try accessing the excel file to see if the data has been recovered

3. **Running a “Check Disk” on flash drives**

Follow the below steps while the USB flash drive has been plugged into your computer:

- Open “Run” and then open “cmd”
- Type in “chkdsk /X /f (USB Drive Letter)” where the “(USB Drive Letter)” is the letter of the corrupted USB Drive. You can get this letter easily from the “My Computer”.

![chkdsk  command prompt](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/check-disk.jpg)

It will now check your disk to and correct any corrupted records.

## **What if none of these methods works?**

In case none of the above methods works to repair Excel document on a flash drive, then you would need a professional Excel repair software such as **[Stellar Repair for Excel](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/?utm_source=Site_Blog&utm_medium=Site_Blog&utm_campaign=Site_Blog_Excel_Flash_Drive)** to restore your files.

## Easy Steps to Make Excel Hyperlinks Working

**Summary:** This blog discusses why hyperlinks won't work in Excel and solutions to fix it. If nothing works, try using Stellar Repair for Excel software to recover your workbook with hyperlinks and all the data intact.

[![Free Download for Windows](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/free-download-windows.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/ "Free Download for Windows")

Hyperlinks in your Excel file could be references to a file’s location on the computer or a location within the same worksheet. Or, hyperlinks might be pointing to a URL. Sometimes, the hyperlinks won’t work and any of the following errors may pop up on your screen on clicking a hyperlink:

**‘Cannot open the specified file.’**

![Cannot open the specified file](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/hyperlink-not-working-main-error.png)

‘This operation has been canceled due to restrictions in effect on this computer. Please contact your system administrator.’

![This operation has been canceled due to restrictions in effect on this computer. Please contact your system administrator](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/hyperlink-not-working-error-1.png)

## Causes of ‘hyperlinks not working in Excel’ problem, and solutions thereof

Here are some of the possible causes behind the ‘hyperlinks not working’ issue and solutions to fix it:

### Cause 1 – Change in the name of the hyperlinked file

If the file name that appears in the hyperlink text is different than the actual file name, it will prevent the hyperlink from working.

#### Solution – Link to the renamed file

Ensure that the links in the Excel file are updated and points to the renamed file. For this, right-click the hyperlink and select ‘Edit the hyperlink’. Next, in the hyperlink address, replace the current filename with the renamed one in the hyperlink address.

### Cause 2 – File name has a pound (#) sign

When you create a hyperlink for a file in Excel, you cannot use a pound character (#) in the file name that appears in the hyperlink. That is because the pound sign is not accepted in hyperlinks and may lead to the ‘Cannot open the specified file’ error.

**Note:** While you can use a pound character in a file name, it cannot be used in hyperlinks in an MS Office document.  

#### Solution – Rename the file name and remove the pound sign

Open the file that contains the ‘#’ sign and rename it by following these steps.

- Right-click the cell containing the hyperlink that is not working, and click **Edit Hyperlink**.
- From the **Address** box, copy the address of the file you are linking to.
- Go to the location where the file is stored, right-click on the file, and click **Rename**.
- Remove the ‘#’ character from the name of the file.
- Go back to the Excel file, right-click on the problematic hyperlink, and choose **Edit Hyperlink**. Next, browse and select the renamed file.
- The renamed file without the pound sign will be added in the **Address** box.
- Click **OK**.

Now try opening the hyperlink.

### Cause 3 – Sudden system shutdown causes abrupt closing of Excel

There may be a discrepancy in the data in hyperlinks when a system shut down suddenly, without properly closing the Excel file. And so, when trying to open a link, it won’t open.

#### Solution – Enable the option to save hyperlinks

There is an inbuilt option in Excel to update hyperlinks every time the workbook is saved. Follow these steps to enable that option:

**Note:** The steps may vary based on the Excel version you are using.

For Excel 2013, 2016, or 2019:

- Open Excel Workbook -> Go to **File**\->**Options**\->**Advanced**
- Scroll down to find the General tab and click on **Web Options**
- Web Options Window pops-up
- In the Web Options Window, go to **Files** Tab and select the ‘**Update Links on save**‘ checkbox
- Click on **OK** button and your option is saved

The steps are also explained in the image below:

![Select Update links on Save in Web Options window](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Uncheck-the-option-to-save-Hyperlinks.jpg)

For Excel 2007:

- Click the **Office** button
- Select **Excel Options**, then follow Step 1) to Step 5), as mentioned above and get the Excel Hyperlinks to work again.
