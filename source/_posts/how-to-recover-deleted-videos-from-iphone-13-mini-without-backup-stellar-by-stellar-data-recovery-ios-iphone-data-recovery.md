## How to recover deleted photos after deleting from ‘Recently Deleted’ on iPhone

The Recently Deleted folder in the Photos App on iPhone is there to recover accidentally deleted photos. However, even if your important photos are deleted from ‘Recently Deleted’ you are not yet out of luck. This post shares how to recover deleted photos after deleting them from ‘Recently Deleted’ on iPhone.

_‘I deleted some important pictures on my iPhone and also deleted them from the ‘Recently Deleted’ folder. Is there any possible way to recover photos after permanently deleting them from the iPhone?’_

When you delete photos from your iPhone, they first go to the ‘Recently Deleted’ folder of the Photos App. Here the photos remain for 30 days. Hence, any picture deleted 30 days ago automatically gets removed after this period, and this time permanently.

However, sometimes you may accidentally delete valuable pictures too. To make the situation worse, even remove image files from ‘Recently Deleted’ or realize the mistake 30 days after deleting!

In any case, can you get photos back after deleting from ‘Recently Deleted’ on your iPhone?

This post addresses the problem situation of permanently deleted photos from iPhones and finds the appropriate solution.

Let’s read on…

## **Understanding permanently deleted photo recovery from iPhone**

You can recover deleted photos from your iPhone after deleting them from the Recently Deleted folder or 30 days of automatic deletion.

Of course, backups — iCloud and iTunes are the immediate go-through solution in such a case. However, Apple backups have their own disadvantage. Photo recovery with iCloud and iTunes results in the loss of your current data on your iPhone!

That’s the reason, iCloud and iTunes are frustrating when you want to get back only a few photos.

So, if you are using another backup service such as Google Drive or OneDrive for iPhone photo backup, they are more convenient.

In addition, apart from backup, iPhone recovery software is just the right solution. It works even when you don’t have a backup or don’t want to eliminate your existing data on your iPhone or iPad.

### 1\. Recover ‘Recently Deleted’ photos from iCloud backup

Use an iCloud backup to recover deleted photos from your iPhone after 30 days of deleting them from the ‘Recently Deleted’ folder. iCloud backup is the best solution to retrieve permanently deleted photos from iPhone free.

Just get on to the below steps to recover deleted photos from iCloud:

- On your iPhone, navigate to **Settings > General > Reset> Erase all Contents and Settings.**

![Erase all Contents and Settings on iphone](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-11.png)

- Select **Erase Now** in the dialog box and follow the prompts until you reach the Apps & Data screen.
- Click on **Restore from iCloud Backup.**

![ Restore from iCloud Backup on iphone](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iphone11-ios14-apps-data-restore-from-icloud-backup.jpg)

- Sign in to your iCloud account.
- Select the recent backup from the list that has the deleted pictures. Click **Restore** to get back the deleted photos on your iPhone.

### 2\. Recover permanently deleted photos from iTunes

If you have an iTunes backup, look for the deleted photos after deleting from ‘Recently Deleted’ in your iTunes backup.

Below are the quick steps:

- Connect your iPhone to your PC or Mac and launch iTunes.
- Click on your iPhone under the device list and select the recent backup date that may contain the permanently deleted pictures.

![recover deleted photos from itunes](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2-768x276.jpg)

- Click **Restore Backup.**

That’s it. You get back the deleted photos on your iPhone.  However, this will replace the current data on the iPhone with the old backup data.

### 3\. Recover recently deleted photos from cloud storage

iPhone users, who don’t completely rely on iCloud and iTunes for backup, use third-party cloud backup solutions. If you are one of those, check your cloud storage for permanently deleted photos on your iPhone. Cloud backups such as Google Drive, iCloud, Dropbox, OneDrive, etc., are efficient ways to save and protect your photos on your iPhone from permanent loss. You can [restore photos on a PC](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/recover-permanently-deleted-photos-from-pc/), Mac, or iPhone by using cloud storage.

### 4\. Recover Recently Deleted Photos with iPhone recovery software \[Recommended\]
