## Factors to Consider When Transferring Data From Oppo Find X6 Pro to iPhone

It’s probably true to say that data migration is a major procedure. It’s not just a simple file-sharing method that can be completed in no time. A lot of things are involved when data is transferred from one device to another. To help you understand it better, below is a list of factors affecting the quality and speed of data migration.

### File Size

The size of files being transferred affects the process in general. This is because the Oppo Find X6 Pro device on the receiving end needs to allocate the data individually to the available space. That’s why the procedure often takes some time to complete if the volume of files is quite large. On the hand one hand, data migration gets completed in a snap if the file size is smaller.

### File Type

The type of files involved in the data transfer is also a factor. Why so? The simplest explanation is that compatibility matters a lot in any form of file transfer. For instance, the procedure will likely fail if the receiver’s device does not support the data you’re trying to send. But don’t worry. There are lots of methods to transfer data from Oppo Find X6 Pro to iPhone 15 if your first try doesn’t work out.

### Device Storage

Device storage is definitely the first thing you should check before going ahead with the data transfer. It is important that the receiver’s device has adequate memory to accommodate the incoming files. Otherwise, the transfer will likely not push through.

### Operating Systems

Migrating files between two smartphones with the same operating system is convenient. It’s because these two devices share an identical data-sharing structure. On the one hand, data migration between two smartphones with different operating systems is almost similar to the former. It’s just that the steps for the latter are quite longer. But don’t sweat it. There are many tutorials that can help you transfer data from Oppo Find X6 Pro to iPhone 15 conveniently.

By using Dr.Fone Switch or Google Drive, you would be able to perform phone migration in an effortless manner. Nevertheless, if there is no free space on your Drive and you wish to manually migrate Android, then you can also make it work. Following are certain ways to migrate Android to Android using different tools and techniques.

**Contacts, Gmail, Fit Data, Play Store, etc.**

**Media content**

The smartest way to Android migrate to new phone your media files (like photos, videos, music, etc.) is by syncing them with Google Drive. If your Drive has limited free space, then you need to manually transfer this data. Connect your device to your system and open its storage. From here, you can manually copy the files having your media content and paste them to a safe location (or directly to the new device’s storage).
