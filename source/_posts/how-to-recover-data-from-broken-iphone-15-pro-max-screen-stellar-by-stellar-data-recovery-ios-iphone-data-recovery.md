## How to Recover Data from Broken iPhone Screen

**Summary:** Struggling to recover data after your iPhone’s screen broke? Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone can help restore data efficiently from an iPhone with a broken screen.

Your iPhone is the most cherished personal gadget as it has become more innovative and influential due to its many valuable features. Moreover, information such as notes, contacts, iMessage, calendar entries, text messages, WhatsApp/Kik messages, pictures, and videos are readily available, making it even more lovable. This is why we need to know how to recover data from broken iPhone screens.

These days, though there are plenty of best ways to back up your data, users often overlook the importance of Backup. It happened with _Jacky Jainco; w_hile taking a DSLR-like photo on his iPhone 14 Pro Max, he accidentally dropped his iPhone and, consequently, broke it.

The real problem was not the broken iPhone but to recover data from iPhone as it was not synced with iTunes and iCloud Backup. As a result, he couldn’t access his files, more importantly, his pictures.

You might have dropped your iPhone several times, and luckily, the excellent cover has saved it on all occasions. However, any drop could cause potential damage putting your data at stake; therefore, leverage iTunes or iCloud backup to recover data from the [damaged iPhone](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/how-to-fix-retrieve-pictures-videos-from-water-damaged-iphone/) screen.

## **Bringing Back Your Data From Backup**

You can restore your files from either iTunes or iCloud Backup. In addition, replacement screens are available; you can have an appointment with the genius bar, get your damaged iPhone fixed, and then recover your data. Also, when backup files are inaccessible, turn to an iPhone data recovery software for an easy solution.

Sorting backup files is unmanageable as they tend to be large, running into GBs. Moreover, the process can be tedious, especially when you have to sort all files, even when you need to recover only a specific file. So it is when [iPhone Data Recovery Software](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/data-recovery-ios/) by Stellar is fruitful. The software lets you recover deleted files from encrypted iTunes backup files or recover data from an iPhone that would not turn on. Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone supports broken iPhone data recovery from series of iPhone 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, XR, XS, X, 8 Plus, 8, 7 Plus, 7, 6S Plus, 6S, 6 Plus, 6, 5S, 5C, 5, 4S, and 4.

## How to recover data from dead iPhone

**Summary:** Recovering data from a dead iPhone is precarious if you don’t acquire knowledge about your iOS device. Be wary of how your device works and its data backup options to avert data loss problems in the future. If your iPhone has turned dead because of a major technical glitch, you can recover the data stored in it using a reliable data recovery software. This blog encapsulates all such concrete details with a step-by-step guide to recover data from dead iPhone.

iPhone is one of the most affluent smartphones loaded with advanced features. Most people invest in it because its upbeat features and advanced technology intrigue them.

If your iPhone is dead and not working at all, and you want to learn how to recover data from dead iPhone, this blog is exclusively for you.

## **Why would an iPhone suddenly go dead?**

These are the possible reasons why iPhone turns dead or blank for hours:

1. A defective charging cable or adapter that doesn’t perfectly pair with your iOS device.
2. A recent iOS update that triggered some unforeseen software error in your iPhone.
3. Faulty or failed hardware, like a battery or a logic board that needs to be replaced.

In either of the above-mentioned conditions, your iPhone will stop responding to any command. Turning the device off and restarting works in rare circumstances, but not always. In such bleak situations, you can try to fix your dead iPhone using these tips:

- Keep a close watch over the charging cable or power adapter and fix the loose ends.
- Put your dead iPhone on charge for at least an hour.
- Connect your iPhone to iTunes or put it on Device Firmware Update (DFU) mode.
- Seek immediate assistance from Apple Support Services.

If these attempts won’t bring your iPhone back to life, certainly it has some major technical glitch that only Apple experts can address. Before submitting your device for the same, recover all the data stored in it. Follow these DIY solutions to **recover data from dead iPhone**:

**Pro Tip:** _If found dead, let your iPhone remain off for as long as possible to avoid data overwriting._

### **Use iCloud to Recover Data from Dead iPhone**

If you are proactively using iCloud to maintain data backup, there is a fair chance to recover your dead phone’s data from it. You can directly recover data from iCloud on another iPhone that doesn’t necessarily require connection to a laptop or computer. All you need is an iPhone that can be turned on at least and let you through the initial steps to login to your iCloud. Don’t forget to erase your dead iPhone before continuing on the new one; otherwise, you won’t get to perform the initial set-up. Follow the steps below to restore dead iPhone’s data from iCloud Backup:

- Turn on the working iPhone and perform the initial setup procedures till you get through **Apps & Data**. Tap on **Restore from iCloud Backup** option and sign in with your Apple ID.

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Apps-Data.jpg)

- A window will prompt you with all backups available for restoring. Select the most recent one that contains all the data you wish to retrieve from your dead iPhone.
- Patiently wait for the data transfer procedure to finish.
- In the data transfer procedure, at some point, you might be asked to enter your Apple ID once again. Enter details to keep the action going.
- Once done, you’ll get a notification of successful data transfer.

You can also transfer all your dead iPhone data to a new one by inserting its SIM card in the new iPhone. Learn here how to [Transfer Data from Old iPhone to New iPhone](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/transfer-data-from-old-to-new-iphone/).
