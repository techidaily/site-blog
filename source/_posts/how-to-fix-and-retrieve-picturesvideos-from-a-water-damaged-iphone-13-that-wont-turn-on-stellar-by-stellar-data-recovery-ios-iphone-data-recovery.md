## What to do if iPhone is not listed when I run the software?


Your iPhone will only appear in the software if it is visible in iTunes on your computer. If your iOS device is not listed in the software, it means iTunes is not installed on your PC or Mac.

Download the latest version of iTunes and then launch the Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone software.

**To launch iTunes on your computer:**

When iTunes is not installed on your computer, [Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/data-recovery-ios/)  automatically generates the below message. It asks to download and install iTunes. You can click on _‘Click here’_ to download iTunes.

If iTunes is already install on your computer and you don’t see your iPhone in the software, update your iTunes to the latest version.
