You may experience the #Value! error in Excel when trying to enter invalid data type into the formulas. Sometimes, it appears when a value is not the expected type or when dates are given a text value. This Excel error may occur due to several reasons. However, the exact cause of this error is difficult to find. Below, we will be discussing some cases where you may get this error and the solutions to resolve the issues.

## Case 1: Wrong Argument Data Type in Formulas

Sometimes, Excel throws the “#Value!” error if it recognizes incompatible arguments in the formulas.

For example: The Date function in the sheet expects only numerical values as arguments. In the below image you can see that when the formula’s string value is used in the month (January), it resulted in the #VALUE! error.

**Solution**

To fix the issue,

- Double-click the formula to verify the type of arguments.

- Correct the argument in the cell (B2).

The formula will work as expected.

## Case 2: Using the Basic Subtraction Formula

Users often experience the #Value! error, when using the basic subtraction formula in Excel.

**Solution**

Check the formula and the type of values in the cell. If these are correct and the error persists, then follow these steps:

- In the **Customized Format** window, search for **List Separator.**

![Image of Customize Format Window](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/customize-format-window.png)

- Check if the **List Separator** is set to **minus (-)**. Change it to **comma (,)**.

![Image of Apply List Seperator In Customize Format Window](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/apply-list-separator-in-customize-format-window.png)

- Click **OK.**
- Now, open the Excel file and again try to use the formula.

## Case 3: Wrong Text Value

The #Value! error can also occur due to the formula’s wrong value.

For example: If you are using the formula to add values in cells and Excel recognizes the unexpected text value, you may get a #Value error.

**Solution**

To fix the issue, you can correct the value or use the SUM function. It is recommended to use functions instead of operations to reduce the errors. In Excel, the formulas with math operators may not able to calculate the text in the cells. The SUM function automatically ignores the text value(er), calculates everything as numbers, and displays the result without the #Value! error.

## Case 4: Blank Space in Cells

You may get the #Value! error if your formula refers to other cells with space or hidden space. Sometimes, spaces that make a cell display blank but actually they are not blank.

![Image of #Value! error in Excel because of Blank Space](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/errormessage-with-blank-space.png)

**Solution**

You can either delete the space or replace the blank space. Here’s how:

#### 1\. Delete the Blank Space

First, check if a cell is blank or not. To do this,

- Select the cell that looks blank.
- Press F2.

![Image of Blank cell Not Showing Space and hence the #Value! error in Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/windows-with-blankcell-not-showing-space.png)

The blank cell won’t show space.

Then, press the Backspace key to delete the space. It will fix the error.

#### 2\. Replace Blank Space

You can also use the “Find and Select” option to replace the blank space in Excel. Here are the steps:

- Open the Excel file that shows #Value! error.
- On the **Home** tab, click **Find & Select > Replace**.

![Image of Find And Select Option](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/find-and-select-option-1024x159.png)

## Case 4: Problem with Network Connection

Many users have reported experiencing errors when using Excel online due to problems with the network connection.

**Solution**

Check your Internet connection and see if it is working properly.  

## Case 5: Wrong Formula Format

If you enter the wrong formula with a missing parenthesis or comma, then Excel can throw the #Value! error. The error can also occur if the application finds a special character within a cell.

**Solution**

Correct the formula and use the ISTEXT function to find the cells with issues.  

## Case 6: Corruption in the Excel File

If none of the above works, then it indicates the Excel file is corrupt. The formulas in the Excel file do not work due to corruption.

**Solution**

You can [use the Open and Repair utility](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/repair-a-corrupted-workbook-153a45f4-6cab-44b1-93ca-801ddcd4ea53) in Excel if you are getting the error due to corruption in Excel file.
