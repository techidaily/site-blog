To learn how to transfer music from Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G to iPhone selectively, follow these steps:

1. Install and open the Dr.Fone toolkit on your computer and click on the “Phone Manager” option from the home screen.

## Part 3: How to transfer music from Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G to iPhone using Android File Transfer?

If you use a Mac, then you can use Android File Transfer to move your data from your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G to your system. Though, to transfer music from Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G to iPhone, you would later need to take the assistance of iTunes. This is because you can’t simply drag and drop your data from your system to the iPhone. While the solution is free, it is certainly quite complicated and is not direct like Dr.Fone.

1. To start with, download and install Android File Transfer from its official [website](https://www.android.com/filetransfer/) on your Mac. It is compatible with macOS 10.7 and higher versions.

Once you have created a playlist on your Spotify account, you can access it from any other device. You can even access your music by visiting its website because it will be stored on Spotify’s server and not your device itself.

## Part 3. How to transfer music from Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G to Other Android Devices using Bluetooth?

Bluetooth transfer is one of the oldest methods that can be used to transfer music from Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G to Other Android Devices, and it is a simple way to make use of it.

**Here are the steps to follow to know how to transfer music from Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G to Other Android Devices.**

**Step 1.** There are two ways you can turn on Bluetooth on your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G

**Method 1:** The first method is to swipe from top to down on your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G to view the swipe menu on some Android OS. You would be able to view and immediately turn on Bluetooth with a single click.

**Method 2:** Go to “Connection” from the Settings Menu on your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G, and then in the Connections options, you will see “Bluetooth”. Make sure it is switched on. Also, ensure that the phone’s Bluetooth visibility is enabled so that your device can be seen and easily paired with the other device.

**Step 2.** Now, switch on the Bluetooth for the destination device as well. Once done, search for your device’s Bluetooth name on the phone and click to pair both Bluetooth devices together.

Mostly, you will be provided with a pair confirmation code that will be displayed on both devices. Click OK to pair both devices successfully.
