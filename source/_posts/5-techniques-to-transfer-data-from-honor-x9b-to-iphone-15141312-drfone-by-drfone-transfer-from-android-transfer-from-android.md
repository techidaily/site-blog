## 5 Techniques to Transfer Data from Honor X9b to iPhone 15/14/13/12

It comes as no surprise that the new iPhone 15 series is turning heads and making a splash worldwide. Well, why not? These recently launched Apple devices are packed with highly advanced features that offer an unparalleled mobile experience to everyone.

But with regard to data transfer and file synchronization, you don’t have to worry a lot. There are many ways you can try to quickly **transfer data from Honor X9b to iPhone 15.**

In this article, we’ll talk about the essential factors involved in data migration of two devices with different operating systems. We will also provide a few tutorials on how to **transfer data from Honor X9b to iPhone 15** conveniently. Continue reading below to learn more.


## Factors to Consider When Transferring Data From Honor X9b to iPhone

It’s probably true to say that data migration is a major procedure. It’s not just a simple file-sharing method that can be completed in no time. A lot of things are involved when data is transferred from one device to another. To help you understand it better, below is a list of factors affecting the quality and speed of data migration.

### File Size

The size of files being transferred affects the process in general. This is because the Honor X9b device on the receiving end needs to allocate the data individually to the available space. That’s why the procedure often takes some time to complete if the volume of files is quite large. On the hand one hand, data migration gets completed in a snap if the file size is smaller.

### File Type

The type of files involved in the data transfer is also a factor. Why so? The simplest explanation is that compatibility matters a lot in any form of file transfer. For instance, the procedure will likely fail if the receiver’s device does not support the data you’re trying to send. But don’t worry. There are lots of methods to transfer data from Honor X9b to iPhone 15 if your first try doesn’t work out.

### Device Storage

Device storage is definitely the first thing you should check before going ahead with the data transfer. It is important that the receiver’s device has adequate memory to accommodate the incoming files. Otherwise, the transfer will likely not push through.

### Operating Systems

Migrating files between two smartphones with the same operating system is convenient. It’s because these two devices share an identical data-sharing structure. On the one hand, data migration between two smartphones with different operating systems is almost similar to the former. It’s just that the steps for the latter are quite longer. But don’t sweat it. There are many tutorials that can help you transfer data from Honor X9b to iPhone 15 conveniently.

## Part 3. 2 Methods To Transfer Contacts From Honor X9b to iPhone

Let's discuss another scenario in which we will transfer the contact list from an Android to an iPhone. If you want to switch from Honor X9b to a new iPhone, you will probably need an effective method to transfer your phone numbers. In this section, we will discuss two simple and quick ways to **how do I transfer contacts from phone to phone:**

### Method 1. Sync Google Account

- **Step 1.** Start by opening the "Contacts" app on your Honor X9b. Choose the "Select all" option to select all contacts and tap the "Share" icon. You can choose any sharing method, but we'll use Gmail to send the VCF file in this case.
