## 5 Techniques to Transfer Data from Honor Play 8T to iPhone 15/14/13/12

It comes as no surprise that the new iPhone 15 series is turning heads and making a splash worldwide. Well, why not? These recently launched Apple devices are packed with highly advanced features that offer an unparalleled mobile experience to everyone.

Switching to a brand-new smartphone requires plenty of work. You first need to set up the new device and configure your digital accounts. But with regard to data transfer and file synchronization, you don’t have to worry a lot. There are many ways you can try to quickly **transfer data from Honor Play 8T to iPhone 15.**

In this article, we’ll talk about the essential factors involved in data migration of two devices with different operating systems. We will also provide a few tutorials on how to **transfer data from Honor Play 8T to iPhone 15** conveniently. Continue reading below to learn more.


## Factors to Consider When Transferring Data From Honor Play 8T to iPhone

It’s probably true to say that data migration is a major procedure. It’s not just a simple file-sharing method that can be completed in no time. A lot of things are involved when data is transferred from one device to another. To help you understand it better, below is a list of factors affecting the quality and speed of data migration.

### File Size

The size of files being transferred affects the process in general. This is because the Honor Play 8T device on the receiving end needs to allocate the data individually to the available space. That’s why the procedure often takes some time to complete if the volume of files is quite large. On the hand one hand, data migration gets completed in a snap if the file size is smaller.

### File Type

The type of files involved in the data transfer is also a factor. Why so? The simplest explanation is that compatibility matters a lot in any form of file transfer. For instance, the procedure will likely fail if the receiver’s device does not support the data you’re trying to send. But don’t worry. There are lots of methods to transfer data from Honor Play 8T to iPhone 15 if your first try doesn’t work out.

### Device Storage

Device storage is definitely the first thing you should check before going ahead with the data transfer. It is important that the receiver’s device has adequate memory to accommodate the incoming files. Otherwise, the transfer will likely not push through.

### Operating Systems

Migrating files between two smartphones with the same operating system is convenient. It’s because these two devices share an identical data-sharing structure. On the one hand, data migration between two smartphones with different operating systems is almost similar to the former. It’s just that the steps for the latter are quite longer. But don’t sweat it. There are many tutorials that can help you transfer data from Honor Play 8T to iPhone 15 conveniently.

### II.II: Transfer Contacts from An Android Smartphone To Another Using Manufacturer Apps

Now, if you have an LG phone, you might be more willing to use LG apps than, say, Xiaomi apps. Same for Xiaomi users who would probably scoff at using Samsung apps on their beloved Xiaomi devices. Manufacturers provide apps on Google Play Store that make transferring content from another device to their devices easy because that suits them to make the processes as seamless and easy for their customers. Even Apple is no different in that regard, they have an app to make it easy for people to switch from Honor Play 8T to iOS.

There are apps by most major manufacturers like Samsung and Xiaomi, including the older titans such as LG that have now stopped manufacturing phones recently. More or less, the steps that users would need to take to transfer contacts from their old devices to the new are fairly common, and you can use the app for your manufacturers, such as Mi Mover for Xiaomi and Samsung Smart Switch. Here is how to transfer contacts from old Android to new Samsung devices using Samsung Smart Switch.

Step 1: Download Samsung Smart Switch on both your old Android and the new Samsung device

Step 2: Keep the Honor Play 8T devices close by, say, on the table. This will not work if the Honor Play 8T devices are in different rooms or too far away.

Step 3: Launch Smart Switch on both the Honor Play 8T devices

Step 4: Tap Send Data on old Android

Step 5: Tap Receive Data on the new Samsung device

Step 6: Tap Wireless method on both devices

Step 7: Tap Allow on your old device to start the transfer process. Don’t worry, this will not dump all your content just yet.

Step 8: On your new Samsung device, choose what you want to transfer - Contacts, in this case.

Step 9: Tap Transfer and when the transfer is done, tap Close.

That’s all it takes to transfer contacts from old phone to new using Samsung Smart Switch. The process is fairly similar for all other apps from manufacturers. You tap Send on the old device, tap Receive on the new device, choose what you want to receive, and that’s it.

**Limitations Of App-based Transfer Methods**

It must be noted that there is one binding limitation with such apps - these apps are not two-way streets. You cannot use Samsung Switch to transfer contacts from Samsung phones to another manufacturer’s phones. The same goes for all other manufacturers. All of them allow data into their devices, not out of their devices onto another manufacturer’s devices, using their apps.

In that regard, using a third-party solution such as Dr.Fone allows you complete freedom to do whatever you want and whenever you want, and even so, Dr.Fone is a great tool to have in one’s arsenal to use every day. How? Because not only does Dr.Fone allow you to transfer contacts from one Android device to another, you have complete freedom to mix the Honor Play 8T devices in all possible ways. So, if you want to transfer from Samsung to Xiaomi, you can do that. You want to transfer from Xiaomi to Samsung, Dr.Fone does that. Transfer from Apple iPhone to Xiaomi? Yes! Xiaomi or Samsung to Apple iPhone? You bet, all supported! And with a clean, easy-to-use interface that does the job quickly and safely.

Transferring contacts from one Android to another Android can be done in two broad ways. One is to transfer contacts from an Android smartphone to another using Bluetooth, which means you can transfer between any smartphone easily and whenever you wish to, without limitations such as which manufacturer the smartphone belongs to. But, how about some more control over what you transfer? If you do not want to use Bluetooth, there is the other way to simply enable Sync in your Google Account, post which your contacts will be uploaded to your Google Account and downloaded to your other device. Or, when you want to do more than transfer, or when you want to have the convenience of doing things from your computer, you have a third way, where you can use Dr.Fone with the Phone Transfer module that lets you select what to transfer, and importantly, lets you transfer between manufacturers easily. So you want to transfer from Honor Play 8T to iPhone, you can do that. You want to transfer from an Android smartphone to another, you can do that. You want to transfer contacts and other data from one manufacturer to another, you can do that. All in just three steps - connect, select, click.
