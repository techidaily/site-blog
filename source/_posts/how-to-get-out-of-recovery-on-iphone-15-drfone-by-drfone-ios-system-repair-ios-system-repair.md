When it comes to downgrading your iOS or iPadOS to an older version, Wondershare Dr.Fone provides a comprehensive set of functions within its tool. You can select the most appropriate version according to the available options. Find out how you can downgrade Apple iOS with the help of Dr.Fone:

![select to downgrade ios](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/downgrade-ios-1.png)

- **Step 2**: Backup iDevice If Needed

A prompt will appear asking you to [back up your iOS device data](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-backup-and-restore/) before executing this process, as the process normally erases the data of the device. Click **Continue** if you do not bother with the erasing of your data.

**Note:** For example, if you are downgrading from iOS version iOS 16.4.1 to version iOS 16.4 the data within the iDevice will be retained. Conversely, if the iDevice is downgraded from iOS 16.4 to iOS 16.3.1, the data will be erased from the device. Thus, it is best to back up your device before performing such an operation.

![backup device if needed](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/downgrade-ios-2.png)

![select the firmware to downgrade ios](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/ios-system-repair-4.png)

**Note:** For example, if you are downgrading from iOS version iOS 16.4.1 to version iOS 16.4 the data within the iDevice will be retained. Conversely, if the iDevice is downgraded from iOS 16.4 to iOS 16.3.1, the data will be erased from the device. Thus, it is best to [back up your iOS device](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-backup-and-restore/) before performing such an operation.

- **Step 5**: Download iOS Firmware on Platform

The respective iOS firmware will start downloading on the platform. Before it is used to downgrade the iOS across the iDevice, the platform will verify the process.
