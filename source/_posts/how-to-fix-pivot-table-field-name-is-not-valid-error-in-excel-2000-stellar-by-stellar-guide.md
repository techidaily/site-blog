## How to fix Pivot Table Field Name is not Valid error in Excel?

The Pivot Table field name is not valid error can occur while creating, modifying, or refreshing data fields in the pivot table. It can also appear when using VBA code to modify the pivot table. It usually occurs when there is an issue with the field name in a code or if there is a hidden or empty column in the pivot table. However, there could be many other reasons behind this error.

## Why the "Pivot Table Field Name is not Valid" Error Occurs?

You can get the "Pivot Table field name not valid" error in Excel due to several reasons. Some possible causes are:

- Excel file is corrupted
- Damaged fields in the pivot table
- Pivot table is corrupted/damaged
- Hidden columns in the pivot table
- Macro (referring to the pivot table) is corrupted
- Preserve formatting option is enabled
- Missing or incorrect fields in the VBA code
- Issue with workbook.RefreshAll method syntax (if using)
- Pivot Table contains empty columns
- Header values or header column is missing in the Pivot Table
- Pivot table is created without headers
- Columns/rows are deleted from the Pivot Table

## Methods to Fix Pivot Table Field Name is not Valid Error in Excel

You can get this error if you have selected the complete data sheet and then trying to create the Pivot Table. Make sure you choose only the data fields that you want to insert in the Pivot Table. If this is not the case, then follow the troubleshooting methods mentioned below.

### **Method 1: Check the Header Value in the Pivot Table**

The "Pivot table field name is not valid" error can occur if you have not set up the pivot table correctly. All the columns having data in them should have header and header values. A pivot table without a header value can create issues. You can check the header and its value from the Formula bar. Change the header if the header value is too lengthy or if it contains special characters.

![Adding reference for the document with details.](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/Recover-Excel-Files/pivotimage/headers-value-in-formula-bars.jpg)

### **Method 2: Check and Change the Data Range in the Pivot Table**

The "Pivot Table field name is not valid" can occur while modifying a field in Pivot Table. It usually occurs if you're trying to add or modify the field by selecting an incorrect data range in the **Create PivotTable** dialog box. The **"Create PivotTable**" feature helps define how data would be displayed within the pivot table.

Let's take a scenario to understand this. Open the Excel file with PivotTable. Click on the fields (you want to add), go to the **Insert** option, and click **PivotTable.**  

![Inserting a Pivot Table from selection](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/Recover-Excel-Files/pivotimage/click-insert-and-then-pivot-option.jpg)

If you select an incorrect range, i.e. A1:E18, instead of correct range - "Expenses**!$A$3:Expenses!$A$4**," you will immediately get the error message.

![Selecting a table range with values for report](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/Recover-Excel-Files/pivotimage/select-table-with-correct-range.jpg)

So, type the correct range under the Select a table or range option and click **OK**.

### **Method 3: Unhide Excel Columns/Rows**

The error can also occur if some columns/rows of the Pivot Table's data source are hidden. When you try to add a hidden column as a field in the PivotTable, the Excel application will fail to read the data of the hidden column. You can check and unhide the Excel columns by following these steps:

- Open the Excel file.
- Locate the hidden column number.
- Move your cursor on the hidden column number and right-click on the space between the columns. Click **Unhide**.  

    ![unhiding the rows in Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/Recover-Excel-Files/pivotimage/click-unhide-option.jpg)

### **Method 4: Check and Delete Empty Excel Columns**

Sometimes, you can get the "Pivot Table field name is not valid" error if you are trying to use an empty column as a field in your Pivot Table. Check the columns with no values in all cells. If found, then delete the empty columns. This method is ideal for small-size Excel files. However, for large-sized files, it is a time-consuming process.

### **Method 5: Unmerge the Column Header (If Merged)**

The "Pivot Table field name is not valid" error can also occur due to merged column headers. The pivot table references headers to identify the data inside the rows or columns. The merged headers can sometimes create data inconsistencies. You can try unmerging the column headers to fix the issue. Follow these steps:

- In the Excel file, go to the **Home**
- Click the **Merge & Center** option and select **Unmerge Cells** from the dropdown.  

    ![unmerging cells from home tab in Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/Recover-Excel-Files/pivotimage/click-home-select-unmergecells.jpg)

### **Method 6: Disable the Background Refresh Option**

If the "background refresh" option in the Excel file is enabled, it may also create issues with Pivot Table. The Excel updates all the pivot tables in the background even after a small change if the background refresh option is enabled. This may create issues if the Excel file is large with too many tables. You can try turning off the "background refresh" option in the Excel file to troubleshoot the issue. Here is how to do so:

- In the Excel file, go to the **Data** tab and then click **Connections**.  

    ![Adding connections from the data](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/Recover-Excel-Files/pivotimage/go-to-data-then-click-connections.jpg)

- In the **Workbook Connections**dialog box, click on the **'Add'** dropdown to add the workbook (in which you need to modify the refresh settings).  

    ![Add the option for the Workbook connections.](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/Recover-Excel-Files/pivotimage/click-add-from-drop-down.jpg)

- Once you have chosen the Excel file, click **Properties.**  

    ![Selecting Properties for the Workbook connections.](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/Recover-Excel-Files/pivotimage/click-properties-on-workbook-connections.jpg)

- In the **Connection Properties** window, unselect the **"Enable background refresh"**option, select the "**Refresh data when opening the file**", and click **OK.  

    ![Enabling the connection properties by enabling and refreshing data](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/Recover-Excel-Files/pivotimage/select-background-refresh-and-refresh-data-option.jpg)

    **

### **Method 7: Check the VBA Code**

The error can also occur when working with PivotTable using VBA code in Excel. Some Excel users reported this error on forums as **run-time error 1004: The PivotTable field name is not valid**. This error usually occurs when there are issues in the VBA code, affecting the PivotTable data source or field references. You can check field names referring to PivotTable or Workbook.RefreshAll function syntax and other errors in the code.

### **Method 8: Repair your Excel File**

One of the reasons behind the "Pivot Table field name is not valid" error is corruption in the Excel file, containing the Pivot Table. You can repair your Excel file using Microsoft built-in utility - Open and Repair. Here's how to use this utility:

- In Excel, navigate to **File > Open.**
- Click **Browse** to choose the affected workbook.
- The **Open** dialog box will appear. Click on the corrupted file.
- Click the arrow next to the **Open**button and then select **Open and Repair**.
- You will see a dialog box with three buttons - **Repair, Extract Data,** and **Cancel**.  

    ![Repairing the corrupt workbook from Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/Recover-Excel-Files/pivotimage/click-repair-option.jpg)

- Click on the **Repair** button to recover as much of the data as possible.
- After repair, a message is displayed. Click **Close**.

###  **Method 9: Use a Professional Excel Repair Tool**

## Solutions to open Excel Read Only Documents

'Excel cannot open read-only documents' is an error message that usually appears when you try to open an Excel (**XLS** or **XLSX**) file downloaded from the Internet, email, or the network server. It may also appear when you try to open an encrypted or password-protected Excel document. In such a case, MS Excel prevents the user from making any changes to the document.

![error message](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/error-message-1-1.png)

## Reasons behind the “Excel cannot access 'xxx.xls.' The Document may be read-only or encrypted” Error

There could be several reasons that may cause the error. Some of them are as follows:

- Corrupt or damaged Excel workbook
- Incompatible or unsupported add-in
- Antivirus or malware software conflict
- Read-Only Excel file
- The file is encrypted
- File or drive read/write permissions issues
- Protected Excel workbook
- Damaged or missing MS Office (MS Excel) program files

## Solutions to Open and Edit Read-Only Excel Documents

Below are a few solutions that can help you fix the 'Excel cannot access 'xxx.xls.' The Document may be read-only or encrypted' error and allow you to open and edit Excel documents.

- **Remove Read-only Attribute from Excel File Properties**

The 'Excel cannot open read-only documents' error message may appear when the Excel file property is set to read-only. To check if this is the case, follow these steps:

- Right-click on the particular Excel (xls/xlsx) document and select '**Properties'.**
  - Uncheck the '**Read-only'** attribute and then click the '**OK'** button.

![Illustrates the 'Read-only' attribute in Excel XLSX document](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/read-only-properties-2.jpg)

Now try to open the Excel document and check if the problem is fixed.

- **Adjust Antivirus Settings**

A few antivirus programs block Excel files and other Office documents by opening those in 'read-only' mode. In such cases, try adjusting the antivirus settings to open the Excel files normally. This will allow you to edit, modify, and save the Excel workbook without encountering the “Excel cannot access 'xxx.xls.' The Document may be a read-only or encrypted” error message.

- **Disable Protected-View**

The error may appear when you try to open an Excel file received as email attachments or downloaded from unsafe source. The file may potentially contain viruses, worms, or other types of malware that could damage the system or the server.

To safeguard the system, MS Excel opens such files in **Protected View**. It may also open an Excel workbook in Protected Mode when it detects a problem with the file. This security feature allows you to read or view Excel files and reduces the risks to the computer system or PC.

However, you can click **File > Info** and then click '**Edit Anyway**' to access and edit file content. You may also disable the **Protected View** setting via **_File > Options > Trust Center > Trust Center Settings…> Protected View._** However, we do not recommend this.

![Protected View](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Protected-view-3.png)

- **Renew/Activate Microsoft Office**

If MS Office is in a deactivated state or its subscription has expired, the Office documents, including the Excel, could be in 'read-only reduced functionality mode.'

In such a scenario, activate Microsoft Office or renew the Office subscription. Then open the Excel workbook and check if the problem of 'Excel cannot open read-only documents' is resolved.

- **Check if OneDrive Storage is Full**

If Excel files are saved on OneDrive with low or no storage space, you may encounter such issues with your files.

To know the amount of free space on OneDrive, follow these steps:

- On your PC, open **Settings** and navigate to OneDrive.
  - Click '**Sync Settings > File Storage**' to see available space.

You may also visit onedrive.live.com, sign in to the account, and then check the available space. If there's no space available or the drive is full, empty the storage space and see if the problem is resolved.

- **Check and Update MS Office and Windows**

Microsoft releases updates to fix known errors. Thus, it is critical to update both Windows and MS Office to the latest release and avoid issues, such as 'Excel cannot access 'xxx.xls.' The Document may be read-only or encrypted.'

- **Repair MS Office (MS Excel)**

The error 'Excel cannot open read-only documents' may appear due to a problem with your MS Office (MS Excel) program. You can repair the MS Office program to resolve such errors. The steps are as follows:

- Open Control Panel and click **Uninstall a Program** link under **Programs.**
- Choose Microsoft Office from the list and click the **Change** button.

![Change button](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/repair-ms-office-4.png)

- Select Quick Repair and then click Repair to fix problems with MS Office and MS Excel. It will also restore any missing or damaged program files.

![Quick Repair and then click Repair to fix problems](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/quick-repair-ms-office-5.png)

After the Repair, open the Excel workbook and check if the error is resolved.

- **Check Permissions**

The error message may also appear if you access an Excel workbook from a network or shared drive due to lack of write permission. Make sure you have read and write permissions assigned for the particular network drive. Alternatively, you can copy the file from the network drive and save it in your local folder to access and edit it without encountering this error message.

- **Repair MS Excel File**

If none of the solutions worked, the Excel workbook could be damaged or corrupt. To repair such damaged Excel workbook or spreadsheet, you can use the inbuilt '**Open and Repair…**’ option in MS Excel or install an **[Excel repair software](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/)**, such as Stellar Repair for Excel. The software comes in handy when the **Open and Repair** option fails to fix the Excel workbook problems. It repairs the corrupt or damaged Excel workbook, extracts all components and content from the file with 100% integrity, and saves them in a new Excel workbook.

## Conclusion

Sometimes, the 'Excel cannot open read-only documents' error can be resolved by a simple restart. But if it doesn't work, you can follow the solutions discussed in this article to resolve the 'Excel cannot open read-only documents' issue.  However, if the issue is caused due to a damaged or corrupt Excel workbook, these methods may not work.

The error indicates that the values you are trying to paste do not match the cell format (Currency, Date, Text, etc.) used in the column. The error can occur if you are attempting to paste information into a merged cell. You can also get this error if the data you are trying to paste contains more columns than the destination worksheet can accept or if the copy area and paste area aren't the same size.

- Lack of permissions
- Excel file is corrupted
- Compatibility issues
- While pasting the merged cells

## **Methods to Fix MS Excel Cannot Paste the Data Error**

The "Microsoft Excel cannot paste the data" error usually appears when copying and pasting data within the spreadsheet. It primarily affects the copy-and-paste feature within the Excel file. However, the impact of this error may vary with the data you are working with. When this error occurs, first try restarting the Excel application. Ensure that you've saved all your important data before restarting the application to prevent data loss. If, after performing this basic step, you still face the issue, then try the following troubleshooting methods.

### **Method 1: Check and Unlock Cells in Excel**

![Click on Locked Cell under Protection Tab](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/cannotpastedata/select-locked-under-protection.jpg)

### **Method 2: Check and Fix the Cell Format**

Sometimes, you can get the "Cannot paste the data" error in Excel if there is an issue with the formatting of the cells in the column (in which you are trying to paste the data). You can check whether the cell formats of the columns of the source file (from where you are copying data) match the destination file (in which you are pasting the cell data). If not, then change the cell format. Here's how to do so:

- In the Excel file, click on the affected column heading (whose cells you need to modify).
- Navigate to the **Home** tab and click the **General** dropdown menu.

**![Navigate to Home and Click general drop down menu in Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/cannotpastedata/click-general-dropdown-menu.jpg)**

- Click on the desired cell format that matches the values you are trying to paste into the column.

### **Method 3: Check Copy and Paste Area Size**

The "data cannot be pasted" issue can also occur if Excel detects the copy area of the range of cells is not of the same size and shape as that of the paste area. So, make sure the size of the range of cells for the paste area is same as the copied area. To ensure this, you can try the following:

- **Use Upper-left Cell**

 You can select the upper-left cell instead of the complete range to paste.

- **Use Paste Special Option**

- You can use the **Paste Special** option to paste the data. To use this option, go to **Home > Paste Special**.

![Navigate to Home And click on Paste Special in Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog/article/Repair-Office-Documents/cannotpastedata/go-to-home-and-then-click-paste-special.png)

- You can choose from the different options, such as paste all, formulas, operations, Transpose, skip blanks, etc. to take control over how the data is pasted.

![Click on Paste and Selection of Operations from Paste Special Properties](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog/article/Repair-Office-Documents/cannotpastedata/select-operations-from-paste-special.jpg)

### **Method 4:** Check and Unmerge Cells

The merged cells in the workbook can create discrepancies when copying and pasting data. These can create mismatch between the source and destination cell areas, resulting in errors. Make sure you are not pasting the data copied from merged cells. You can check and unmerge the cells using the below steps:

- Open the Excel file (in which you are copying data) and go to the Home tab.
- Click Merge & Center > Unmerge Cells.

## Here are some additional solutions you can try to fix the "Cannot paste the data" error in Excel

### **Check the Excel File Format**

Sometimes, the copy and paste error can occur if you try to move data from an older version of Excel file (XLS) into a newer version file (XLSX) or vice versa. You can try to change or convert the file format to resolve the issue.

### **Clear Clipboard**

Too many items on the clipboard can prevent you from copying and pasting the data. You can [empty your clipboard](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/office/clear-the-clipboard-7afbf55f-d7d5-4096-87a0-eb17f821d321) by deleting all clips.

To insert additional columns, click on the column heading, click **Home**, and then select **Insert.**

### **Remove Incompatible Add-ins**

Sometimes, incompatible or faulty add-ins can also create conflicts with Excel's clipboard operations, leading to the error.

[![Free Download for Windows](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/free-download-windows.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/ "Free Download for Windows")

You can use the Filter function in Excel to filter data in large-sized Excel files quickly. While using Excel filters, sometimes, you face a situation where the filter is disabled or may fail to function properly.

![Filter Option Disabled](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/filter-option-disabled-1024x112.jpg)

The Excel filter usually fails to work if you have not selected the complete and correct range of data. Let’s learn more about the “Sort and Filter not working in Excel” issue and look at the possible methods to fix it.

## **Why the Filter is not Working in Excel?**

You can face the “filter is not working” issue if you are applying the filter on a protected worksheet or trying to find the data from a hidden row. Besides this, there could be many other reasons contributing to this issue, such as:

- The data you are trying to filter is in merged cells.
- The Excel file automatically selected the data up to the first empty cell, excluding the remaining rows.
- Grouped sheets in Excel file.
- Blank row in the Excel sheet.
- You are trying to apply a filter on an invalid data range.
- The workbooks in which you’re facing the filter issues are corrupted.
- You are specifying incorrect criteria in the filter columns.

## **Solutions to Resolve the Filter is not Working Issue in Excel**

There might be two scenarios: the Excel filter option is disabled/grayed out or the filters fail to function properly. You can follow the given troubleshooting solutions to resolve the issue based on the scenario you’re facing.

## **Scenario 1 – Filter Option is Disabled or Grayed Out**

### **Method 1: Check and Un-group the Worksheet**

When you apply filters to a single sheet in a grouped set, Excel disables the filter option in other sheets within the group. You can check the grouped sheets and try ungrouping them to enable the filter option. Here’s how to do so:

- In the Excel file, go to the **Group** section.

![Excel file navigation: Accessing the Group section
](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/go-to-group-section-1024x114.jpg)

- Right-click on the **Ungroup Sheets.**

Alternatively, you can press the Shift + Alt + Left keys to ungroup the sheets.

### **Method 2: Unprotect Worksheet**

The “disabled Excel filter” issue can also occur if your worksheet is protected. You can unprotect the worksheet to enable the filter option. To do so, go to the **Review** tab and then select **Unprotect Sheet.**

![Excel file: Navigating to Group section, resolving 'disabled Excel filter' issue with worksheet protection, unprotecting sheet from Review tab for filter activation.](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/go-to-review-and-select-unprotect-sheet-1024x115.jpg)

### **Method 3: Check and Uninstall Excel Add-ins**

Sometimes, the Excel filter gets disabled due to faulty or corrupted Excel add-ins. You can run the Excel in Safe mode to check whether the issue has occurred due to add-ins. To do this, type excel /safe in the Run window and click **OK.**

![Troubleshooting disabled Excel filter caused by add-ins: Running Excel in Safe mode with 'excel /safe' in Run window](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/type-excel-safe-command.jpg)

In safe mode, if you see the filter option, it indicates some problematic Excel add-ins were causing the issue. In such a case, you can check and uninstall the faulty Excel add-ins to fix the issue.

## **Scenario 2 – Filter is not Working**

### **Method 1: Try Clearing Filters**

Sometimes, the Excel filter fails to work correctly if some filters from the previous sessions are still active. In such a case, you can clear the applied filters. Follow the below steps:

- In Excel file, click Sort & Filter option.
- Select clear.

![Excel: Clicking 'Sort & Filter' and selecting 'Clear' option.](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/click-clear-option.jpg)

### **Method 2: Select Entire Data**

The filter not working issue in Excel can occur when the range selected for filtering is incomplete or incorrect. You need to make sure that you’ve selected the entire data range in Excel. You can use the Ctrl+A keys to select the entire content in the worksheet.

### **Method 3: Check and Delete Blank Cells from the Table’s Columns**

When you apply a filter to the data, Excel expects data to be in a continuous range. Excel filters do not consider the blank cells, thereby resulting in incorrect functioning of the filter. To resolve this issue, check and delete all blank cells. In case your Excel file is too large to delete the blank cells, then you can add a “Serial number” row as an alternative. Adding serial number row creates a data continuity, thus helping in fixing the filter-related issue.

### **Method 4: Unhide Hidden Rows and Columns**

Hidden rows or columns in worksheets can also affect the filter functionality. You can check and unhide rows/columns to troubleshoot the issue. Here is how to do so:

- In the affected Excel file, go to Home.
- Click on **Format > Hide & Unhide**.

![Excel file: Navigating to Home, accessing Format > Hide & Unhide.](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/click-format-select-hide-or-unhide-option-1024x228.jpg)

[![Free Download for Windows](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/free-download-windows.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/ "Free Download for Windows")

Imagine the frustration of an employee if an Excel workbook he took hours to complete became corrupted for some reason threatening to erase all the data saved in it. Not just that, a corrupted Excel workbook can wreak havoc for the organization too since it poses a risk of permanently deleting critical business information like work records or employee trackers.

Unless a backup of all important Excel files exists, recovering data lost due to damage/corruption to them is next to impossible. However, we’ve conducted some research and found some pretty neat hacks to help you extract data from corrupt excel files without much hassle.

## Primary reasons triggering Excel file corruption

As we always point out, to solve a problem for good, getting to its root is imperative. Here are the main reasons that cause Excel file corruption. Knowing these reasons can help you keep Excel corruption at bay for a considerably long time.

- Abrupt system shutdown when you’re editing an Excel sheet
- Bugs / Defects in your Excel application or installation
- Hardware failures like bad sectors on the hard drive where Excel sheets are saved
- Virus Infection / Malware Attack
- Excessive data storage within a single Excel file
- Faulty Excel Macros and CSE Formulas

Depending upon the extent of damage, there can be several ways to perform corrupt Excel file repair.

## How to repair corrupt Excel files?

There are a couple of manual methods that can help you [repair corrupt Excel files](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/).

1. **If the damaged Excel sheet can be opened, immediately save its copy; thereafter**:
    - Open it with a later version of Excel and save it as a new workbook.
    - If this doesn’t work, open it in Excel’s latest version and save the workbook in HTML or HTM format.
    - Once this is done, reopen the HTML file and save again in XLS format.
    - Lastly, open the file and try saving it in SLK format (symbolic link)

**Note:** It is important to note that saving an Excel workbook in HTML format causes loss of features like custom views, scenarios, unused styles or number formats, natural language formulas, data consolidation settings, custom function categories, etc. In SYLK format only the active worksheet is saved so if using this method, you’ll need to repeat these steps for each worksheet.

2. **Use Excel’s inbuilt Repair function as follows:**
    - Launch Microsoft Excel and go to **Office button -> Open**
    - In the Open dialog box, select the damaged Excel file
    - On the bottom-right corner of the Open dialog box, you will find a drop-down next to **Open** Click on it and select **Open and Repair**
    - This will launch the inbuilt Repair module of Excel and you’ll see a dialog box asking you to select an option from **Repair** or **Extract Data**
    - Click on **Repair** to initiate the repair process.
    - If this doesn’t work, repeat steps 1-4, and when Excel asks you to select an option, select **Extract Data** from corrupt excel file. Thereafter, follow the instruction Excel shows and you should be able to retrieve your data, but you may end up losing some formulas.
3. **If you cannot open the Excel, download Spreadsheet viewer from the Microsoft website and open the file using this program. Thereafter copy all data into a new Excel.**

**Note:** This method will cause much of your formatting, formulas, and more to be lost.

4. **You can download Open Office from its official website OpenOffice.org and try opening the Excel in it. The two programs are very similar so all data should automatically align in the correct place and with the correct formatting.**

**Note:** With this method, VBA code cannot be recovered due to incompatibility between OpenOffice.org and Excel.

## Full-proof method for corrupt Excel file repair

If you find the above methods confusing, or you wish to perform Excel file repair without having to face any data and formula loss, or you cannot achieve the desired results with any of these methods, stop wasting any more time with methods that will only frustrate you more.
