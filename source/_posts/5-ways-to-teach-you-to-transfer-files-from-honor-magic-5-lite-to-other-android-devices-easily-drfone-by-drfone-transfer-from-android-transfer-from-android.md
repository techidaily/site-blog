How to transfer music from iPod to Android:

**Step 1:** Open Dr.Fone’s Phone Transfer tool

Make a connection between your iPod and your Honor Magic 5 Lite on your computer. Launch [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/phone-switch/) on your computer and navigate to Toolbox > Phone Transfer.

**Step 2:** Specify the source and destination devices

After connecting them, the platform will identify the connected devices and load their data. Choose the Source and Destination devices to set the transfer path. Use the Flip button to alter the transfer direction (for example, when you want to transfer from Honor Magic 5 Lite to iPod instead).

![Specify the source and target devices.](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/transfer-ios-to-android-1.png)

**Step 3:** Choose the music category for the transfer

Proceed to select the types of data you wish to transfer. Checkmark music and click the Start Transfer button. If you want to remove existing data from the destination device, you can select “Clear data before copy.”

**Step 4:** Disable iCloud syncing

Now, Dr. Fone's Phone Transfer tool should prompt a specific operation on the window. Follow the instructions to turn off iCloud syncing.

## Conclusion

Transferring music seamlessly between iPod and Android devices, and vice versa, has become more accessible than ever with the right tools and methods. Bluetooth technology serves as a wireless bridge, allowing users to effortlessly move their favourite music from an iPod to an Android device.

On the other hand, there are also apps like Move to iOS and [Dr.Fone Basic](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) that facilitate the transfer of music depending on your needs. These options empower users to break through the traditional barriers of device exclusivity and seamlessly enjoy their music collections across different ecosystems.
