## How to Recover Data from Broken iPhone Screen

**Summary:** Struggling to recover data after your iPhone’s screen broke? Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone can help restore data efficiently from an iPhone with a broken screen.

Your iPhone is the most cherished personal gadget as it has become more innovative and influential due to its many valuable features. Moreover, information such as notes, contacts, iMessage, calendar entries, text messages, WhatsApp/Kik messages, pictures, and videos are readily available, making it even more lovable. This is why we need to know how to recover data from broken iPhone screens.

These days, though there are plenty of best ways to back up your data, users often overlook the importance of Backup. It happened with _Jacky Jainco; w_hile taking a DSLR-like photo on his iPhone 14 Pro Max, he accidentally dropped his iPhone and, consequently, broke it.

The real problem was not the broken iPhone but to recover data from iPhone as it was not synced with iTunes and iCloud Backup. As a result, he couldn’t access his files, more importantly, his pictures.

You might have dropped your iPhone several times, and luckily, the excellent cover has saved it on all occasions. However, any drop could cause potential damage putting your data at stake; therefore, leverage iTunes or iCloud backup to recover data from the [damaged iPhone](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/how-to-fix-retrieve-pictures-videos-from-water-damaged-iphone/) screen.

## **Bringing Back Your Data From Backup**

You can restore your files from either iTunes or iCloud Backup. In addition, replacement screens are available; you can have an appointment with the genius bar, get your damaged iPhone fixed, and then recover your data. Also, when backup files are inaccessible, turn to an iPhone data recovery software for an easy solution.

Sorting backup files is unmanageable as they tend to be large, running into GBs. Moreover, the process can be tedious, especially when you have to sort all files, even when you need to recover only a specific file. So it is when [iPhone Data Recovery Software](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/data-recovery-ios/) by Stellar is fruitful. The software lets you recover deleted files from encrypted iTunes backup files or recover data from an iPhone that would not turn on.
