Download MoboRobo and install this Android USB file transfer tool on your computer. Upon opening it, you will be prompted to connect your Motorola Edge 2023 with a USB cable or over WiFi, and then once connected, you will be asked permission to install the app on your Motorola Edge 2023 as well.

Once connected, you will be brought to this home page, notice the options to use different devices as well as connected through Wi-Fi.

As with Mobogenie, once you are on the software, it is fairly easy to navigate around, and you can do everything from sending SMS from your PC to transferring apps and contacts. However, a drawback is that the management of your music requires you to have all your MP3 files on your PC and move them on to the software- not extremely inconvenient, but as we will see much easier solutions exist.

We recommend the use of Wondershare Dr.Fone, as it is more reliable and provides a simple user-friendly interface that allows you to manage your Motorola Edge 2023 with ease. You can also transfer files between Android and Mac easily.
