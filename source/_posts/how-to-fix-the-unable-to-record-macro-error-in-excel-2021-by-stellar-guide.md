A personal macro workbook (Personal.xlsb file) is a hidden workbook in Excel that stores all macros in a single workbook. This allows you to automate processes while working in Excel. Sometimes, when recording macro codes in the personal macro workbook, you may get the message “**Personal Macro Workbook in a startup folder must stay open for recording**”. When you click on the **OK** button, it will show the “unable to record” error. This prevents you from recording the macros. Below, we’ll see the causes behind this error and discuss how to resolve this error.

## **Causes of Unable to Record Macro Error**

You may be unable to record macros in Excel due to several reasons. Let’s take a look at the possible causes that can lead to this issue.

- The location of personal.xlsb file is changed.
- Personal.xlsb file is corrupted.
- Macros are disabled.

## **Methods to Fix the “Unable to Record Macro” Error in Excel**

Here are some possible solutions that can help you resolve the unable to record macro error in Excel.

### Method 1: Check the Path of XLStart Folder

You may be unable to record macros if the path of XLStart folder is incorrect. It is a folder where the Personal.xlsb file is stored by default. Follow these steps to find out the path of this folder:

- Open MS Excel. Go to **File > Options**.
- Click **Trust Center > Trust Center Settings**.

- In the **Trust Center Settings** window, click on **Trusted Locations**.

- Verify the path of the **XLSTART** folder and modify it if there is an issue.
- Once you are done, click on **OK**.

### Method 2: Change Macro Security

The “Unable to record macro” error can occur if macros are disabled in the Macro Security settings. You can try changing the macro settings using the below steps:

- In MS Excel, go to **File > Options > Trust Center**.

- Under **Trust Center,** click on **Trust Center Settings**.

- Select **“Enable all macros”** and then click **OK.**

### Method 3: Check Add-ins for Disabled Items

If there are any items in add-ins that are disabled, they may prevent Excel from functioning properly. You can check and enable the items in MS Excel using the below steps:

- Click **File > Options.**

![Go To Options](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/go-to-options-1.png)

- In **Excel Options**, click on the **Add-ins** option.
- Select **Disabled Items** from the **Manage** section and click on **Go**.

![Add-ins In Excel Options](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/add-ins-in-excel-options.png)

- The **Disabled Items** window is displayed.
- Click on the disabled item and then click **Enable**.
- Restart Excel for the changes to take place.

### Method 4: Repair your Excel File

You may fail to record macros if there is corruption in the workbook. In such a case, you can use the “Open and Repair” utility in MS Excel to repair the corrupt workbook. To use this tool, follow these steps:

- Open your Excel application.
- Click **File > Open**.
- Browse to the location where the corrupted file is stored.
- In the **Open** dialog box, choose the corrupted workbook.

![Open Dialog Box](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/open-dialog-box.png)

- From the **Open** dropdown list, click **Open and Repair**.

![Open And Repair Window](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/open-and-repair-window.png)

Excel will prompt you to repair the file or extract data from it. Click **Repair** to retrieve maximum data. If the Repair option fails, then click on the Extract Data option to recover the data without formulas and values.

If the Microsoft utility “Open and Repair” fails to repair the corrupted Excel workbook, then try a professional Excel repair tool such as Stellar Repair for Excel. It is an advanced tool that can easily repair severely corrupted Excel (XLSX and XLS) files. It can recover all the file items, including chart sheets, cell comments, tables, macros, formulas, etc. without impacting the properties and cell format of the Excel file.
