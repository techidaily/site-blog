## How to Recover deleted pictures on iPhone? 5 Best Solutions

For many iPhone users, photos are the most important data stored on their device – so losing those photos can be a disaster.

However, even if you accidentally deleted some or all of your pictures on iPhone, you can get them back.

We'll discuss how to recover deleted photos on your iPhone with or without backup.

## **How to Recover Deleted Pictures on iPhone?**

There are five best solutions to recover deleted pictures on iPhone. Use the solution that fits your needs and helps you recover your lost pictures.

### 1\. Recover Deleted Pictures on iPhone from Recently Deleted Albums

Pictures taken with the iPhone Camera application are saved by default in the Photos application. If a photo or video is deleted, it's moved to the Recently Deleted folder in the Photos app. This folder is the same as your computer’s Recycle Bin and retains the deleted photos for 30 days. Once this period expires, your photos are permanently deleted from this folder. Perform these steps if you want to recover recently deleted photos on your iPhone:

- Open the **Photos** app.
- Tap on **Albums** at the bottom.

![recover deleted image from recently deleted album-1](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/data-recovery/recover-deleted-pictures-on-iphones/Recover-Deleted-Pictures-from-Recently-Deleted-Album-1.jpg)

- Scroll down to find the **Recently** **Deleted** folder.

- Now, tap **Recover**, and the pictures will be returned to their original iPhone albums.

**Note** – If you want to restore all the deleted photos from your **Recently Deleted** folder, tap on the **Recover All** button.

## **How to Recover Deleted Pictures on iPhone From a Backup?**

If your photos are not in the **Recently Deleted** folder, you might get them back by restoring your iPhone from a previous backup. There are three ways to restore deleted photos on iPhone – iCloud website, iTunes backup, or Finder.

When recovering photos from your iPhone from backup, pay attention to the date of creation of your backups. Use the most recent backup but don't delete all older backups. It's always good to have multiple backups if something goes wrong.

### 2\. Recover Photos on iPhone using iCloud via the iCloud website

Apple's iCloud Backup helps you recover deleted photos from your iPhone to your system. For iCloud to automatically back up all your pictures and videos, you must first set up and enable iCloud Photos on your device. Here's how to enable iCloud Photos to Backup all your photos:

- Open the **Settings** app on your iPhone.
- Tap **iCloud** and then go to **Photos**.

![icloud photos enable](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/data-recovery/recover-deleted-pictures-on-iphones/icloud-photos-ios-enable-1.jpg)

- Toggle on **iCloud Photos** to enable it.

### 3\. Recover Photos on iPhone using iTunes

- Connect your iPhone to your Mac system with macOS Mojave or an earlier version.
- Click on the **iPhone** icon at the upper-left corner of your iTunes window.

- Once the restoration process is complete, check the **Photos** app to see if the deleted photos were recovered. If not, try repeating the process and return to the most recent backup or choose an older backup.

- Open **Finder** on your Mac with macOS Catalina 10.15 or above.
- Connect your **iPhone** to your Mac system.
- Select your iPhone from the location lists on the left.

## How to Put iPhone or iPad on Recovery mode? (Step by Step Tutorial)

**Summary:** DFU or Recovery mode is a way to recover your iPhone or iPad using a computer in case of technical issues. Read this post for a step-by-step process of how to enter and exit Recovery Mode and DFU mode on iPhone.

 [![Free Download for Windows](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/free-download-windows.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/data-recovery-ios/ "Free Download for Windows")[![Free Download for Mac](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/free-download-Mac.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/data-recovery-ios/ "Free Download for Mac")

When you run out of solutions to troubleshoot your iPhone, Recovery Mode or DFU Mode comes as a rescue. Whether iPhone stops booting or fails to restore, you can use the functions in iPhone and fix the issue.

But the method to bring an iPhone in DFU or Recovery Mode varies in each iPhone model and iPad.

This post will guide you on how to enter and exit Recovery and DFU Modes in different iPhone and iPad variants. But first, understand what these iPhone functions are and their uses.

![How to Put iPhone or iPad on recovery mode](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-8b4e845/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Reamp_How-to-Enter-Recovery-or-DFU-Mode_edited-Clean.jpg)

## **What is Recovery Mode and its use?**

Recovery Mode uses iBoot to upgrade or restore your iPhone. iBoot is a bootloader program for iOS devices. Recovery Mode helps install the same or above iOS firmware version already on your iPhone. The iPhone screen in Recovery Mode prompts to connect iPhone to iTunes, showing a computer image.

Recovery Mode helps fix iPhone updates or restore issues, such as [iPhone stuck at the Apple logo](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/how-to-fix-an-iphone-stuck-on-the-apple-logo/), unable to open the locked iPhone or want to reset iPhone but [forgot iPhone passcode](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/forgot-iphone-password-best-solutions/).

## **What is DFU Mode and its use?**

Device Firmware Update or DFU mode lets your iPhone connect with iTunes on the computer without iBoot. As DFU mode doesn’t use iBoot, you can make changes in the operating system of the iOS device. An iPhone in DFU mode has a completely black screen.

Putting iPhone into DFU mode is the solution when Recovery Mode doesn’t resolve the problem. DFU mode can restore or upgrade iPhone. This mode is also commonly used to downgrade or [jailbreak iPhone](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/how-to-jailbreak-iphone-without-data-loss/)s.

### **Caution — you may lose all your iPhone data!**

If you are entering DFU mode, make sure to [back up your iPhone data](https://support.apple.com/en-in/guide/iphone/iph3ecf67d29/ios). DFU mode [permanently erases iPhone data](https://www.stellarinfo.com/erase-iphone-data.php). So always back up your videos, photos, messages, chats, Notes, etc., either to iCloud or iTunes.

However, if you have lost iPhone data and don’t have a backup, then immediately download iPhone data recovery software — [Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/data-recovery-ios/). The software helps to restore lost or deleted iPhone contacts, call logs, photos, videos, text, FaceTime, audio, chats, Calendar, Notes, Safari bookmarks, etc. It is quick to recover and extremely user-friendly.
