- Click Save. A dialog box appears asking to select the location to save photos. You can save the recovered photos either onto your iPhone or computer.

### 5\. Enable iCloud Photos

Sometimes you could see the photos on iPhone but not on your synced iPad, iPod Touch, or Mac. To view these missing iPhone pictures on the synced iOS devices turn on iCloud Photos.

iCloud Photos stores the photos in iCloud. It ensures you can view them on your synced devices. If you can't find a photo on your synced iPad, iPhone, or Mac etc., enable iCloud Photos under Settings of the iOS device.

Steps to turn on iCloud Photos on iPhone/iPad/ iPod Touch

- Click to follow Settings > \[your name\] > iCloud

![turn on iCloud Photos on iPhone](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/data-recovery/file-recovery/enable-icloud-photos.jpg)

- Tap Photos
- Toggle on iCloud Photos.

- Go to System Preferences > iCloud.

![To turn on iCloud Photos on Mac](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/article/recover_photos_iphone/10.png)

- Next to Photos, click Options

![Click options](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/article/recover_photos_iphone/hey.jpg)

- Select iCloud Photos

Next, connect to Wi-Fi and wait for some time until your photos appear again on the synced devices.

Tip: When you turn on iCloud Photos, photos upload to iCloud but they are not duplicated in your iCloud backup. So make backup of your photo library. You can download your photos from iCloud.com to your PC/Mac and store them as a separate library or store them on a separate drive.
