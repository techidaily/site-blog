This post will guide you on how to enter and exit Recovery and DFU Modes in different iPhone and iPad variants. But first, understand what these iPhone functions are and their uses.

![How to Put iPhone or iPad on recovery mode](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-8b4e845/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Reamp_How-to-Enter-Recovery-or-DFU-Mode_edited-Clean.jpg)

## **What is Recovery Mode and its use?**

Recovery Mode uses iBoot to upgrade or restore your iPhone. iBoot is a bootloader program for iOS devices. Recovery Mode helps install the same or above iOS firmware version already on your iPhone. The iPhone screen in Recovery Mode prompts to connect iPhone to iTunes, showing a computer image.

Recovery Mode helps fix iPhone updates or restore issues, such as [iPhone stuck at the Apple logo](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/how-to-fix-an-iphone-stuck-on-the-apple-logo/), unable to open the locked iPhone or want to reset iPhone but [forgot iPhone passcode](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/forgot-iphone-password-best-solutions/).

## **What is DFU Mode and its use?**

Device Firmware Update or DFU mode lets your iPhone connect with iTunes on the computer without iBoot. As DFU mode doesn’t use iBoot, you can make changes in the operating system of the iOS device. An iPhone in DFU mode has a completely black screen.

Putting iPhone into DFU mode is the solution when Recovery Mode doesn’t resolve the problem. DFU mode can restore or upgrade iPhone. This mode is also commonly used to downgrade or [jailbreak iPhone](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/how-to-jailbreak-iphone-without-data-loss/)s.

### **Caution — you may lose all your iPhone data!**

If you are entering DFU mode, make sure to [back up your iPhone data](https://support.apple.com/en-in/guide/iphone/iph3ecf67d29/ios). DFU mode [permanently erases iPhone data](https://www.stellarinfo.com/erase-iphone-data.php). So always back up your videos, photos, messages, chats, Notes, etc., either to iCloud or iTunes.

However, if you have lost iPhone data and don’t have a backup, then immediately download iPhone data recovery software — [Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/data-recovery-ios/). The software helps to restore lost or deleted iPhone contacts, call logs, photos, videos, text, FaceTime, audio, chats, Calendar, Notes, Safari bookmarks, etc. It is quick to recover and extremely user-friendly.

## How to recover deleted photos after deleting from ‘Recently Deleted’ on iPhone

The Recently Deleted folder in the Photos App on iPhone is there to recover accidentally deleted photos. However, even if your important photos are deleted from ‘Recently Deleted’ you are not yet out of luck. This post shares how to recover deleted photos after deleting them from ‘Recently Deleted’ on iPhone.

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/featured-Recover-photos-deleted-from-Recently-Deleted-on-iPhone.jpg)

_‘I deleted some important pictures on my iPhone and also deleted them from the ‘Recently Deleted’ folder. Is there any possible way to recover photos after permanently deleting them from the iPhone?’_

When you delete photos from your iPhone, they first go to the ‘Recently Deleted’ folder of the Photos App. Here the photos remain for 30 days. Hence, any picture deleted 30 days ago automatically gets removed after this period, and this time permanently.

However, sometimes you may accidentally delete valuable pictures too. To make the situation worse, even remove image files from ‘Recently Deleted’ or realize the mistake 30 days after deleting!

In any case, can you get photos back after deleting from ‘Recently Deleted’ on your iPhone?

This post addresses the problem situation of permanently deleted photos from iPhones and finds the appropriate solution.

Let’s read on…

## **Understanding permanently deleted photo recovery from iPhone**

You can recover deleted photos from your iPhone after deleting them from the Recently Deleted folder or 30 days of automatic deletion.

Of course, backups — iCloud and iTunes are the immediate go-through solution in such a case. However, Apple backups have their own disadvantage. Photo recovery with iCloud and iTunes results in the loss of your current data on your iPhone!

That’s the reason, iCloud and iTunes are frustrating when you want to get back only a few photos.

So, if you are using another backup service such as Google Drive or OneDrive for iPhone photo backup, they are more convenient.

In addition, apart from backup, iPhone recovery software is just the right solution. It works even when you don’t have a backup or don’t want to eliminate your existing data on your iPhone or iPad.

### 1\. Recover ‘Recently Deleted’ photos from iCloud backup

Use an iCloud backup to recover deleted photos from your iPhone after 30 days of deleting them from the ‘Recently Deleted’ folder. iCloud backup is the best solution to retrieve permanently deleted photos from iPhone free.

Just get on to the below steps to recover deleted photos from iCloud:

- On your iPhone, navigate to **Settings > General > Reset> Erase all Contents and Settings.**

![Erase all Contents and Settings on iphone](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-11.png)

- Select **Erase Now** in the dialog box and follow the prompts until you reach the Apps & Data screen.
- Click on **Restore from iCloud Backup.**

![ Restore from iCloud Backup on iphone](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iphone11-ios14-apps-data-restore-from-icloud-backup.jpg)

- Sign in to your iCloud account.
- Select the recent backup from the list that has the deleted pictures. Click **Restore** to get back the deleted photos on your iPhone.

### 2\. Recover permanently deleted photos from iTunes

If you have an iTunes backup, look for the deleted photos after deleting from ‘Recently Deleted’ in your iTunes backup.

Below are the quick steps:

- Connect your iPhone to your PC or Mac and launch iTunes.
- Click on your iPhone under the device list and select the recent backup date that may contain the permanently deleted pictures.

![recover deleted photos from itunes](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2-768x276.jpg)

- Click **Restore Backup.**

That’s it. You get back the deleted photos on your iPhone.  However, this will replace the current data on the iPhone with the old backup data.

### 3\. Recover recently deleted photos from cloud storage

iPhone users, who don’t completely rely on iCloud and iTunes for backup, use third-party cloud backup solutions. If you are one of those, check your cloud storage for permanently deleted photos on your iPhone. Cloud backups such as Google Drive, iCloud, Dropbox, OneDrive, etc., are efficient ways to save and protect your photos on your iPhone from permanent loss. You can [restore photos on a PC](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/recover-permanently-deleted-photos-from-pc/), Mac, or iPhone by using cloud storage.
