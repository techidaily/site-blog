- Connect your iPhone to the computer via USB cable
-  Launch Stellar Data Recovery from iPhone
- Choose **Recover from iCloud Backup**, Select **Contacts and Call Logs** and click **Next**

![Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone- recover from iCloud](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-8b4e845/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/iCloud-1.png)

- Click on Save and browse the desired location to save the recovered contacts.

### **3\. Restore** **from iTunes Backup**

If your iPhone contacts are synced with iTunes backup, use **Recovery from iTunes backup** to recover missing iPhone contacts.

- Connect your iPhone to your computer and launch the software
- On the home screen, choose Recover from iTunes, select Contacts and Call Logs, and click **Next**

![Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone- recover from iTunes backup](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-8b4e845/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/iTunes-backup-1.png)

- The software analyzes your system and lists all the available iTunes backup files, as shown below. If you cannot find the desired backup file, you can click on **Add Backup** to manually add the backup file from the system. Now, select the file and click **Scan**

![Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone- recover from iTunes backup](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-8b4e845/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/iTunes-backup-2.png)

- After scanning, select “Contacts” on your left pane, all the contacts in the selected backup file will be displayed in the right pane.
-  Then, Select All or particular items by clicking on the associated checkbox.
- Click on Save and browse the desired location to save the recovered contacts.

Minor changes in the iPhone Settings can also help restore deleted contacts. Try the below Setting changes and check if they work for you:

- Change Contacts’ Groups Settings
- Reset the Network Connections
- Change Default Account in Settings back to iCloud (works for iPhone 8/7/6s)

### **1: Change Contacts’ Groups Settings**

- Go to your **Contacts,** tap into **Groups**
-  Uncheck **All iCloud**
- Select **All on iPhone**

![Change Contacts' groups settings](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-8b4e845/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/123-1.jpg)

- Click on **Done** (top right)
- Check if you got back all your contacts

### **2: Reset the Network Connections**

- Under **Settings** > **General** > **Reset** > **Reset Network Settings**

![Reset iPhone Network Connections](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-8b4e845/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/main-qimg-164d17fa45a35b970a0c4651fa2c690a.png)

- Enter your passcode
- Choose **Reset Network Settings** to continue ignoring the message that this action will delete all your network settings.

This action will clear your current saved networks and Wi-Fi passwords, but you can always re-enter your network passwords later. So give this a try to retrieve lost contacts.

### **3: Change Default Account in Settings back to iCloud (works for iPhone 14, 13, 12, 11, X, 8, 7, 6)**

![Restore Contacts through iPhone Settings](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-8b4e845/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/iphone-settings2.png)

- Go to your iPhone **Settings** > **Mail, Contacts, Calendars** > **Contacts**
- Click **Default Account**
- Select **iCloud** instead of **On my iPhone**
- Check if your phone’s missing contacts recovered

##  **To Wrap-up**

Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone intelligently restores your missing or accidentally deleted contacts without causing loss of iPhone’s existing data, unlike iTunes or iCloud Backup recovery methods. Changing the iPhone settings can also help you get back missing contacts. So now no need to worry about the contacts list loss. Instead, try the above methods and recover deleted contacts on your iPhone.
