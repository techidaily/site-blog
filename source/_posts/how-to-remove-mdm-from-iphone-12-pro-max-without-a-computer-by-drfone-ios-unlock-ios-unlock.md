## What Is Remote Management on iPhone 12 Pro Max

Providing employees with company-issued iPhones or other organizational devices has become a common practice in the corporate landscape. These devices serve as multifunctional tools, facilitating seamless communication, productivity, and access to critical business applications.

If you noticed the "Remote Management" screen on your iPhone 12 Pro Max, that's the manifestation of MDM at work. As we have mentioned, MDM is a security feature to oversee and control devices used by their employees. This ensures that company policies are enforced and sensitive information is protected.

MDM allows administrators to configure settings, install applications, and enforce security protocols on connected devices. They can stop you from using certain things, such as the App Store and AirDrop. MDM also handles VPN settings and lists of blocked websites.

## How to Remove Remote Management on iPhone 12 Pro Max via Settings

The primary reason people want to remove remote management on iPhone is that they've acquired it from their workplace or as a second-hand purchase. If the remote management profile isn't removed, you won’t be able to use the iPhone fully. Sometimes, even a factory reset won't unlock the iPhone if the remote management is still in place.

Thankfully, if the devices are still logged in with the MDM profile credentials, you can still resolve this through the Settings menu.

How to remove Remote Management on iPhone via Settings:

- **Step 1**: Locate iPhone Settings.

Open the `"Settings"` app on your iPhone 12 Pro Max. Scroll until you find `"General"` from the menu and tap.

- **Step 2**: Open your profile on VPN & Device Management.

In the General Settings, open the `"VPN & Device Management"` option and tap on the profile associated with the MDM.

- **Step 3**: Check for the `"Remove"` button.

Look for a button that says `"Remove"` within the profile. If you see this button, you can proceed to remove remote management from iPhone on your own. Follow any on-screen prompts or confirmations to complete the removal process.

- **Step 4**: Contact MDM Admin if Needed:

If you do not see the `"Remove" button`, it means that you need to contact the MDM administrator for further assistance. Reach out to them to initiate the removal process.

## How to Set Up Face ID on Your iPhone 12 Pro Max

Sometimes, you may just want to disable Face ID temporarily or the issue gets solved, and want to activate Face ID again. Setting up a Face ID on your iPhone 12 Pro Max is easy. To set up Face ID, sit in a comfortable spot with adequate lighting and follow these steps:

- **Step 1**: Go to `Settings` > `Face ID` and Passcode and enter your passcode. If you have not set up a passcode yet, you will necessarily have to create one now before proceeding forward.

- **Step 2**: Tap Set Up Face ID to start the process.

- **Step 3**: Hold your iPhone 12 Pro Max in the portrait orientation at about an arm‘s length away from your face and then tap Get Started.

In case you are getting the following error:

There are a few things you can try to resolve this, you can try to update your iPhone 12 Pro Max to the latest iOS. At this point, you may even try running a beta version to see if that helps. If you are running a beta version, you may downgrade back to the release version to see if that resolves the error. Betas can both make and break things.

If this does not resolve it, you need to take the device to the nearest service center. The TrueDepth camera system has components that might have been damaged or might not be working properly, for whatever reason, and the service personnel is equipped to resolve this issue for you at the earliest.


## Unlock Disabled iPhone 12 Pro Max Using Find My iPhone App

There are times you have another iOS device in the family or just lying around, you can use that device to unlock your disabled iPhone 12 Pro Max. This method is particularly useful if you're traveling with family or alone, and only have family members with their own iOS devices or, say, your iPad with you. As always, note that all these methods will wipe your data from your iPhone.

- **Step 1**: Open the Find My app on your other iOS device or Mac.

## Activation Lock Primer

Apple products are costly, and they are prized. When a 5-year-old Android device might be left alone without anyone stealing it, you cannot risk that with an iPhone 6S, even today. Apple has built an Activation Lock in its devices to deter theft and so far, as we know, it has largely succeeded. If your iPhone 12 Pro Max 13 gets stolen, no one else can use it with their Apple ID unless they key in the credentials it was using previously (your credentials) and, even then, Apple has bolstered iCloud Find My Activation Lock to be more restrictive. You may have to key in a lot of information ranging from your device password (if you are also using the same Apple ID on a Mac) to your iOS device passcode too, obviously, your Apple ID password. It is a system that works in favor of Apple users.

Yet, in some cases, users want to get around the Activation Lock for genuine reasons, say, when you buy a used Apple device from someone. They may have forgotten to remove that device from their Apple account and Activation Lock would not let you use it. Or, you are an IT administrator, and you manage devices given out to employees. Some employees did not remove their accounts from their devices, and now those iPhones are riddled with Activation Lock. You can remove it using this step-by-step guide.



## Reasons for Locked Apple ID

There can be a few reasons why your Apple ID is locked. You forgot the password and now it is locked since you entered the wrong password too many times. A scarier prospect, albeit a real one, is that some malicious actor attempted to login into your Apple ID account but failed. Had they succeeded, you would have gotten a message that 'your Apple ID is being used on another device' now.

Apple does a lot to ensure that your Apple ID remains safe. You trust Apple with a lot of your data, including financial data by way of your credit cards associated with Apple ID to make purchases on the App Store and iTunes Store. Therefore, some of the time, Apple preempts issues by proactively locking up your Apple ID or even disabling it. It goes without saying that sometimes it is something so simple as a software error that is believed to have locked up Apple IDs for many users around the world a while ago. It is also entirely possible that it was some malicious actor probing the servers for accounts.

All of these will result in a locked Apple ID that users will have to reset their password to in order to gain access back.

## Checking If Your Apple ID Is Locked

![Checking If Your Apple ID Is Locked](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/unlock-iphone-without-apple-id/2.avif)

A locked Apple ID is rather unmistakable. Your iPhone 12 Pro Max would keep telling you that your Apple ID is locked for your security. Your Apple ID could be locked or disabled altogether if someone has tried to gain access to your account (and, obviously, failed). Apple would disable access to the Apple ID unless you are able to prove rightful ownership and reset the password successfully.

## Prevent iPhone From Getting Disabled Again

After all this to get access back, you might think let's go passcode-less and prevent the hassle. Don't do that - that's worse and unsafe. Instead, here are tips you can use to make sure you don't accidentally disable your iPhone 12 Pro Max again.

- **Tip 1: About Passcodes**

1.1 Set a passcode that is easier to remember for you but difficult to think of for thieves and others.
1.2 Never use birthdates, years, vehicle numbers or any such numbers that may be easily tried by others.
1.3 Never use repeating numbers.
1.4 Do not use your ATM PIN as your phone passcode either. Think of some digits or combination that makes sense to you and only you. And then use it.

- **Tip 2: Use Face ID**

Along with Passcode comes the option of Face ID on your iPhone 12 Pro Max, so use that. That will minimize instances for you to enter your passcode, and may make you forget it again, though. So, make sure that the passcode you set does make sense to you and you can remember it always without effort.

Not all of us have the memory of elephants. With Touch ID and Face ID on our iPhones minimizing the use of passcodes, we may forget them. Another factor in forgetting passcodes is being too smart for our own good and trying to set up such a secure passcode that even we are not able to remember it. If we enter incorrect passcode too many times, the iPhone disables itself and we need to restore it to factory settings to unlock it again. There are several ways to do that, depending on the time you are willing to spend on the job and your proficiency level, along with the resources that you have with you right now. For example, if a method requires use of another iOS device and you do not have it, that method is not useful to you right now, pick another. Lastly, when the device is reset, instead of going passcode-less to make sure that you do not forget the passcode again, it is best to set up a passcode that you can somehow remember.
