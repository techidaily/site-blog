## How to Recover deleted pictures on iPhone? 5 Best Solutions

For many iPhone users, photos are the most important data stored on their device – so losing those photos can be a disaster.

However, even if you accidentally deleted some or all of your pictures on iPhone, you can get them back.

We'll discuss how to recover deleted photos on your iPhone with or without backup.

## **How to Recover Deleted Pictures on iPhone?**

There are five best solutions to recover deleted pictures on iPhone. Use the solution that fits your needs and helps you recover your lost pictures.

### 1\. Recover Deleted Pictures on iPhone from Recently Deleted Albums

Pictures taken with the iPhone Camera application are saved by default in the Photos application. If a photo or video is deleted, it's moved to the Recently Deleted folder in the Photos app. This folder is the same as your computer’s Recycle Bin and retains the deleted photos for 30 days. Once this period expires, your photos are permanently deleted from this folder. Perform these steps if you want to recover recently deleted photos on your iPhone:

- Open the **Photos** app.
- Tap on **Albums** at the bottom.

- Scroll down to find the **Recently** **Deleted** folder.

- Now, tap **Recover**, and the pictures will be returned to their original iPhone albums.

**Note** – If you want to restore all the deleted photos from your **Recently Deleted** folder, tap on the **Recover All** button.

## **How to Recover Deleted Pictures on iPhone From a Backup?**

If your photos are not in the **Recently Deleted** folder, you might get them back by restoring your iPhone from a previous backup. There are three ways to restore deleted photos on iPhone – iCloud website, iTunes backup, or Finder.

When recovering photos from your iPhone from backup, pay attention to the date of creation of your backups. Use the most recent backup but don't delete all older backups. It's always good to have multiple backups if something goes wrong.

### 2\. Recover Photos on iPhone using iCloud via the iCloud website

Apple's iCloud Backup helps you recover deleted photos from your iPhone to your system. For iCloud to automatically back up all your pictures and videos, you must first set up and enable iCloud Photos on your device. Here's how to enable iCloud Photos to Backup all your photos:

- Open the **Settings** app on your iPhone.
- Tap **iCloud** and then go to **Photos**.
