## How to fix Pivot Table Field Name is not Valid error in Excel?

The Pivot Table field name is not valid error can occur while creating, modifying, or refreshing data fields in the pivot table. It can also appear when using VBA code to modify the pivot table. It usually occurs when there is an issue with the field name in a code or if there is a hidden or empty column in the pivot table. However, there could be many other reasons behind this error.

## Why the "Pivot Table Field Name is not Valid" Error Occurs?

You can get the "Pivot Table field name not valid" error in Excel due to several reasons. Some possible causes are:

- Excel file is corrupted
- Damaged fields in the pivot table
- Pivot table is corrupted/damaged
- Hidden columns in the pivot table
- Macro (referring to the pivot table) is corrupted
- Preserve formatting option is enabled
- Missing or incorrect fields in the VBA code
- Issue with workbook.RefreshAll method syntax (if using)
- Pivot Table contains empty columns
- Header values or header column is missing in the Pivot Table
- Pivot table is created without headers
- Columns/rows are deleted from the Pivot Table

## Methods to Fix Pivot Table Field Name is not Valid Error in Excel

You can get this error if you have selected the complete data sheet and then trying to create the Pivot Table. Make sure you choose only the data fields that you want to insert in the Pivot Table. If this is not the case, then follow the troubleshooting methods mentioned below.

### **Method 1: Check the Header Value in the Pivot Table**

The "Pivot table field name is not valid" error can occur if you have not set up the pivot table correctly. All the columns having data in them should have header and header values. A pivot table without a header value can create issues. You can check the header and its value from the Formula bar. Change the header if the header value is too lengthy or if it contains special characters.

![Adding reference for the document with details.](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/Recover-Excel-Files/pivotimage/headers-value-in-formula-bars.jpg)

### **Method 2: Check and Change the Data Range in the Pivot Table**

The "Pivot Table field name is not valid" can occur while modifying a field in Pivot Table. It usually occurs if you're trying to add or modify the field by selecting an incorrect data range in the **Create PivotTable** dialog box. The **"Create PivotTable**" feature helps define how data would be displayed within the pivot table.

Let's take a scenario to understand this. Open the Excel file with PivotTable. Click on the fields (you want to add), go to the **Insert** option, and click **PivotTable.**  

![Inserting a Pivot Table from selection](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/Recover-Excel-Files/pivotimage/click-insert-and-then-pivot-option.jpg)

If you select an incorrect range, i.e. A1:E18, instead of correct range - "Expenses**!$A$3:Expenses!$A$4**," you will immediately get the error message.

![Selecting a table range with values for report](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/Recover-Excel-Files/pivotimage/select-table-with-correct-range.jpg)

So, type the correct range under the Select a table or range option and click **OK**.

### **Method 3: Unhide Excel Columns/Rows**

The error can also occur if some columns/rows of the Pivot Table's data source are hidden. When you try to add a hidden column as a field in the PivotTable, the Excel application will fail to read the data of the hidden column. You can check and unhide the Excel columns by following these steps:

- Open the Excel file.
- Locate the hidden column number.
- Move your cursor on the hidden column number and right-click on the space between the columns. Click **Unhide**.  

    ![unhiding the rows in Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/Recover-Excel-Files/pivotimage/click-unhide-option.jpg)

### **Method 4: Check and Delete Empty Excel Columns**

Sometimes, you can get the "Pivot Table field name is not valid" error if you are trying to use an empty column as a field in your Pivot Table. Check the columns with no values in all cells. If found, then delete the empty columns. This method is ideal for small-size Excel files. However, for large-sized files, it is a time-consuming process.

### **Method 5: Unmerge the Column Header (If Merged)**

The "Pivot Table field name is not valid" error can also occur due to merged column headers. The pivot table references headers to identify the data inside the rows or columns. The merged headers can sometimes create data inconsistencies. You can try unmerging the column headers to fix the issue. Follow these steps:

- In the Excel file, go to the **Home**
- Click the **Merge & Center** option and select **Unmerge Cells** from the dropdown.  

    ![unmerging cells from home tab in Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/Recover-Excel-Files/pivotimage/click-home-select-unmergecells.jpg)

### **Method 6: Disable the Background Refresh Option**

If the "background refresh" option in the Excel file is enabled, it may also create issues with Pivot Table. The Excel updates all the pivot tables in the background even after a small change if the background refresh option is enabled. This may create issues if the Excel file is large with too many tables. You can try turning off the "background refresh" option in the Excel file to troubleshoot the issue. Here is how to do so:

- In the Excel file, go to the **Data** tab and then click **Connections**.  

    ![Adding connections from the data](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/Recover-Excel-Files/pivotimage/go-to-data-then-click-connections.jpg)

- In the **Workbook Connections**dialog box, click on the **'Add'** dropdown to add the workbook (in which you need to modify the refresh settings).  

    ![Add the option for the Workbook connections.](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/Recover-Excel-Files/pivotimage/click-add-from-drop-down.jpg)

- Once you have chosen the Excel file, click **Properties.**  

    ![Selecting Properties for the Workbook connections.](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/Recover-Excel-Files/pivotimage/click-properties-on-workbook-connections.jpg)

- In the **Connection Properties** window, unselect the **"Enable background refresh"**option, select the "**Refresh data when opening the file**", and click **OK.  

    ![Enabling the connection properties by enabling and refreshing data](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/Recover-Excel-Files/pivotimage/select-background-refresh-and-refresh-data-option.jpg)

    **

### **Method 7: Check the VBA Code**

The error can also occur when working with PivotTable using VBA code in Excel. Some Excel users reported this error on forums as **run-time error 1004: The PivotTable field name is not valid**. This error usually occurs when there are issues in the VBA code, affecting the PivotTable data source or field references. You can check field names referring to PivotTable or Workbook.RefreshAll function syntax and other errors in the code.

### **Method 8: Repair your Excel File**

One of the reasons behind the "Pivot Table field name is not valid" error is corruption in the Excel file, containing the Pivot Table. You can repair your Excel file using Microsoft built-in utility - Open and Repair. Here's how to use this utility:

- In Excel, navigate to **File > Open.**
- Click **Browse** to choose the affected workbook.
- The **Open** dialog box will appear. Click on the corrupted file.
- Click the arrow next to the **Open**button and then select **Open and Repair**.
- You will see a dialog box with three buttons - **Repair, Extract Data,** and **Cancel**.  

    ![Repairing the corrupt workbook from Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/Recover-Excel-Files/pivotimage/click-repair-option.jpg)

- Click on the **Repair** button to recover as much of the data as possible.
- After repair, a message is displayed. Click **Close**.

###  **Method 9: Use a Professional Excel Repair Tool**

If the Excel file is heavily damaged or corrupted, then the "[Open and Repair" utility may not work](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/) or provide the intended results.

## How to Fix a Corrupted .xls File? The Everything Guide

Undoubtedly, Excel is so powerful that it can help you to process, analysis, and store data, in masses.

That’s the reason it has been there for years and helping this world in data.

But…

With all those powers comes some nasty problems which no Excel users like to face. Can you guess what I’m talking about?

Think about a Corrupted Excel File. Nightmare? Isn’t it?

And do you remember that last time when you have opened a workbook and you got a message that this workbook is might corrupt?

The TRUTH is, this is something which you cannot avoid, but, you can [prepare yourself in the best way](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/) and deal with it like a PRO.

So today, in this post, I’d like to share with you to everything you need to know about a corrupt Excel file (.xls), why it happens, how to fix it like a PRO, and much more.

...let’s get started.

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/Mac-Regional/introduction.jpg)

**Note**: In this post, we’ll be covering the .xls version (which is the extension for the file which is created in Excel 2007 or the earlier versions) and if you want to know about the new version, [here’s the quick fix](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/) for that.

## Why My Excel File Got Corrupted?

There can be one or multiple reasons for an Excel file to get corrupted. Below I have detailed about some of the major of them.

### 1\. Large Excel File

You can store data in a workbook the way you want but sometimes using excessive thing can make an Excel file bigger in size.

And that kind of data files can crash at any point in time. Here are a few things which make the Excel files heavy, like

- Conditional Formatting.
- Colors formatting.
- Using merged cells in place of text alignment.
- Volatile functions: Formulae that iterate every time you open or change a cell value; OFFSET, NOW.
- Using a complete column or row as a reference than the data set range.
- Using complex formulas; VLOOKUP in place of Index/Match, Nested If in place of MAXIFS, MINIFS.
- Calculations or reference across workbooks.

**Related:** [How to Fix Formatting Issues in Excel](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/)

### 2\. Abrupt System Shutdown

Shutting down the system without following the procedure can corrupt your data file.

This shut down can be due to a power failure or any other unexpected technical challenges.

So it is always important to follow the procedures and shut down your system properly to avoid data losses.

### 3\. Infected Excel File (Virus Attack)

This is the most common and obvious reason for Excel file corruption.

Although we always keep our system safe using various Antiviruses, still there is always a probability of virus attacks and loss of important files.

It is always advised to use a safe and strong antivirus compatible with your system requirements.

## What are the Signs to Know When an Excel File is Corrupted?

In this section, we will discuss what are the signs which you can get when an Excel file is corrupted, let’s dig into it.

### 1\. The File is Corrupt and Cannot Be Opened

This is one of the most common messages you can see when your workbook is corrupted.

But there is also a chance that it is just because of the version compatibility where you have a .xls file but you are using the latest version of Excel check out this detailed post by Priyanka

### 2\. We Found a Problem with some Content in this File…

There’s another error message which you can get while opening a file:

We Found a Problem with some content in Do you want us to recover as much as we can? If you trust the source of this workbook, click yes.

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/Mac-Regional/we-found-a-problem-with-some-content-in-this-file.jpg)

There are a lot of applications out there (I think almost every) which exports the data as a .xls format. Those files have a greater chance of having this kind of error.

### 3\. “Filename.xls” cannot be accessed

There can also be a situation where you get the error:

_“Filename.xls” cannot be accessed. The file may be corrupted, located on a server that is not responding._

Well, this message is a bit misleading.

You won't be able to decide that your file is actually corrupted or just not on the location.

## My Excel File Got Corrupted, now What Should I Do?

There are many ways to recover the data from the corrupt excel files. But before you start, it is always advised to create a copy of the corrupted file.

You can save a lot of time with [**Stellar Repair for Excel,**](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/) which make data recovery just with few clicks.

But before you go for a data recovery software, let's try out some manual steps which can help.

When a workbook get corrupted the first thing comes to the mind is to recover data from it…

...and you what there’s a simple option there in the Excel which you can use to do this. Below are the steps you need to follow:

- First of all, open the Excel and click on the office icon.

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/Mac-Regional/office-icon.jpg)

- After that, go to the “Open” and select the file which is corrupted.

- Now, click on the open drop-down and select “Open and Repair”.

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/Mac-Regional/open-repair.jpg)

- At this point, you have two options:

1. **Repair File**
2. **Extract Data**

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/Mac-Regional/extract-data.jpg)

Let’s get into both of these options one by one...

### 1\. Repair File

This option helps you to repair the file and the moment you click on it it takes a few seconds afterward and shows you the result with a message box and also provide you a log file.

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/Mac-Regional/repair-file.jpg)

And once it is done with repairing, you'll get your file opened and you can save that file as a new copy.

Yes, that’s it.

### 2\. Extract Data

If somehow you aren’t able to get your file repaired, you can also extract data from that file using “Extract Data” option.

Even in this option, you can get data in two ways.

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/Mac-Regional/open-repair-options.png)

1. **As Values**
2. **With Formulas**

In the first option, Excel simply extracts data as value ignoring all the formulas driving those value (which is **the best way if you just need to have that data back** ).

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/Mac-Regional/open-repai-values.jpg)

But in the second option, Excel tries to recover the formulas as much as possible.

Check out this [**smart technique by Jyoti**](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/) which you can use it you aren’t able to recover data from the file.

## Preventions to Not to have any Excel File Go Corrupt in Future

Future is fragile, what I’m trying to say is the more you work in Excel and process data there could be a chance that your workbook goes corrupt.

If there’s no security then what an EXCEL POWER user should do?

Well, there are few things which you can do or take care of while working with Excel so that you won’t have to worry about corruption of Excel workbooks.

Let’s see what you can do…

### 1\. Change Recalculation Option

Now here’s the thing when you work with a hell lot of data, there a common thing that you gotta using formulas. Right?

But, the thing these formulas are something which makes your Excel file slows down sometimes make them go corrupt.

There’s one small tweak you can do in your workbook is change the calculation method.

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/Mac-Regional/change-recalculation-option.jpg)

Now with the manual calculation, you just need to whenever you open your file it won’t recalculate all the formulas.

And when you update your data you can simply click on the “Calculate Now” and it will calculate all the formulas again.

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/Mac-Regional/calculate-now.jpg)

**Quick Tip:** Beware of Volatile Functions and use them with caution as recalculates them every time you change something in the worksheet.

### 2\. Use VBA Codes Instead of Formulas

Now, this is what I do when I need to use complex formulas in a workbook.

Here’s how you can do this: Let’s say you have a formula in the cell A1, like below, which calculates the age.

\="You age is "& DATEDIF(Date-of-Birth,TODAY(),"y") &" Year(s), "& DATEDIF(Date-of-Birth,TODAY(),"ym")& " Month(s) & "& DATEDIF(Date-of-Birth,TODAY(),"md")& " Day(s)."

Now, instead of simply entering it into the cell A1 which I would write a macro code which inserts this formula into the cell A1 and then convert it into the a value.

**Here’s the code:**

Sub CalculateAge()  
Range("B1").Value = \_  
"=""Your age is """ & \_  
"&DATEDIF(A1,TODAY(),""y"")" & \_  
"&"" Year(s), """ & \_  
"&DATEDIF(A1,TODAY(),""ym"")" & \_  
"&"" Month(s), and """ & \_  
"&DATEDIF(A1,TODAY(),""md"")" & \_  
"&"" Days(s)."""  
Range("B1") = Range("B1").Value  
End Sub

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/Mac-Regional/VBA-codes.jpg)

**Note:** To write these code you need to have basic understading of VBA (make sure [check out this guide](https://excelchamps.com/learn-vba/) for this).

### 3\. Use a File Recovery Application

Recently we asked a quick question to our readers on ExcelChamps that if they have ever faced a situation where they got a corruption message in Excel.

You’ll be astonied to hear that 50% percent of the people said “YES” they faced this thing in the past.

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/Mac-Regional/yesr.jpg)

Now, this is alarming, if you are heading a team or you have a bunch of people in your company who use Excel…

…there’s a high probability that half of them gonna face this issue. So the best way to deal with this to have an App FIX your Excel file for you.

With **STELLAR REPAIR FOR EXCEL,** you just need a few clicks, yes that’s right. Let me show you with the below steps:

## How to Fix Excel Run Time Error 1004

**Summary:** Run-time errors are windows-specific issues that occur while the program is running. This blog will teach you how to fix Excel run-time error 1004. In addition, you’ll learn about an Excel repair tool that can help fix the error 1004 if it occurs due to corruption in Excel files.

[![Free Download for Windows](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/free-download-windows.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/ "Free Download for Windows")

VBA (Microsoft Visual Basic for Application) is an internal programming language in Microsoft Excel. Sometimes, when users try to run VBA or generate a Macro in Excel, the Run-time error 1004 may occur. This error may occur due to the presence of more legend entries in the chart, file conflict, incorrect Macro name, and corrupt Excel files. In this blog, we have discussed the reasons and shared some solutions to resolve run-time error 1004.

## **Why This Error Occurs?**

The run time error 1004 usually occurs when you run a VBA macro with the Legend Entries method to modify the legend entries in the MS Excel chart. It happens when the chart contains more legend entries than the available space, macro name conflicts, corrupt Excel files, or data-types mismatch in the VBA code.

## **Ways to Fix Excel Run-Time Error 1004?**

Try the below workarounds to fix Excel run-time error 1004:

### **Create a Macro to Reduce Chart Legend Font Size**

Sometimes, Excel throws the run-time error when you try to run VBA macro to change the legend entries in a Microsoft Excel chart. This error usually occurs when Microsoft Excel truncates the legend entries because of the more legend entries and less space availability. To fix this, try to create a macro that shrinks/minimize the font size of the Excel chart legend text before the VBA macro, and then restore the font size of the chart legend. Here is the macro code:

```
VBCopy
Sub ResizeLegendEntries()

With Worksheets("Sheet1").ChartObjects(1).Activate
      ' Store the current font size
      fntSZ = ActiveChart.Legend.Font.Size

'Temporarily change the font size.
      ActiveChart.Legend.Font.Size = 2

'Place your LegendEntries macro code here to make
         'the changes that you want to the chart legend.

' Restore the font size.
      ActiveChart.Legend.Font.Size = fntSZ
   End With

End Sub
Note: Make sure you have an Excel chart to run the code on the worksheet.
```

### **Uninstall Microsoft Work**

## Solutions to Open and Edit Read-Only Excel Documents

Below are a few solutions that can help you fix the 'Excel cannot access 'xxx.xls.' The Document may be read-only or encrypted' error and allow you to open and edit Excel documents.

- **Remove Read-only Attribute from Excel File Properties**

The 'Excel cannot open read-only documents' error message may appear when the Excel file property is set to read-only. To check if this is the case, follow these steps:

- Right-click on the particular Excel (xls/xlsx) document and select '**Properties'.**
  - Uncheck the '**Read-only'** attribute and then click the '**OK'** button.

![Illustrates the 'Read-only' attribute in Excel XLSX document](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/read-only-properties-2.jpg)

Now try to open the Excel document and check if the problem is fixed.

- **Adjust Antivirus Settings**

A few antivirus programs block Excel files and other Office documents by opening those in 'read-only' mode. In such cases, try adjusting the antivirus settings to open the Excel files normally. This will allow you to edit, modify, and save the Excel workbook without encountering the “Excel cannot access 'xxx.xls.' The Document may be a read-only or encrypted” error message.

- **Disable Protected-View**

The error may appear when you try to open an Excel file received as email attachments or downloaded from unsafe source. The file may potentially contain viruses, worms, or other types of malware that could damage the system or the server.

To safeguard the system, MS Excel opens such files in **Protected View**. It may also open an Excel workbook in Protected Mode when it detects a problem with the file. This security feature allows you to read or view Excel files and reduces the risks to the computer system or PC.

However, you can click **File > Info** and then click '**Edit Anyway**' to access and edit file content. You may also disable the **Protected View** setting via **_File > Options > Trust Center > Trust Center Settings…> Protected View._** However, we do not recommend this.

![Protected View](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Protected-view-3.png)

- **Renew/Activate Microsoft Office**

If MS Office is in a deactivated state or its subscription has expired, the Office documents, including the Excel, could be in 'read-only reduced functionality mode.'

In such a scenario, activate Microsoft Office or renew the Office subscription. Then open the Excel workbook and check if the problem of 'Excel cannot open read-only documents' is resolved.

- **Check if OneDrive Storage is Full**

If Excel files are saved on OneDrive with low or no storage space, you may encounter such issues with your files.

To know the amount of free space on OneDrive, follow these steps:

- On your PC, open **Settings** and navigate to OneDrive.
  - Click '**Sync Settings > File Storage**' to see available space.

You may also visit onedrive.live.com, sign in to the account, and then check the available space. If there's no space available or the drive is full, empty the storage space and see if the problem is resolved.

- **Check and Update MS Office and Windows**

Microsoft releases updates to fix known errors. Thus, it is critical to update both Windows and MS Office to the latest release and avoid issues, such as 'Excel cannot access 'xxx.xls.' The Document may be read-only or encrypted.'

- **Repair MS Office (MS Excel)**

The error 'Excel cannot open read-only documents' may appear due to a problem with your MS Office (MS Excel) program. You can repair the MS Office program to resolve such errors. The steps are as follows:

- Open Control Panel and click **Uninstall a Program** link under **Programs.**
- Choose Microsoft Office from the list and click the **Change** button.

![Change button](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/repair-ms-office-4.png)

- Select Quick Repair and then click Repair to fix problems with MS Office and MS Excel. It will also restore any missing or damaged program files.

![Quick Repair and then click Repair to fix problems](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/quick-repair-ms-office-5.png)

After the Repair, open the Excel workbook and check if the error is resolved.

- **Check Permissions**

The error message may also appear if you access an Excel workbook from a network or shared drive due to lack of write permission. Make sure you have read and write permissions assigned for the particular network drive. Alternatively, you can copy the file from the network drive and save it in your local folder to access and edit it without encountering this error message.

- **Repair MS Excel File**

If none of the solutions worked, the Excel workbook could be damaged or corrupt. To repair such damaged Excel workbook or spreadsheet, you can use the inbuilt '**Open and Repair…**’ option in MS Excel or install an **[Excel repair software](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/)**, such as Stellar Repair for Excel.

## Fix the Too many different cell formats Error in Excel?

Excel has set a limit on the number of unique cell formats within a workbook. Excel 2003 allows up to 4000 different cell format combinations, whereas Excel 2007 and later versions allow a maximum of 64000 combinations. When this limit exceeds, you may encounter errors, such as “Too many different cell formats”. It can prevent you from inserting or modifying workbook rows or columns. Sometimes, it prevents you to copy and paste the content within the same or different workbooks.  This error may also occur due to various other reasons.

You can encounter the “Too many different cell formats” error due to the below reasons:

- Formatting is missing in the workbook.
- Size of your Excel file has increased due to excessive use of complex formatting (conditional formatting).
- Workbook contains a large number of merged cells.
- There are multiple built-in or custom cell styles.
- Excel workbook is corrupted.
- The unused styles are unexpectedly copied to new workbooks (when moving or copying a worksheet from one to another).
- Workbooks contain multiple worksheets with different cell formatting.

## **Methods to Fix the “Too many different cell formats” Error in Excel**

First, check that your Excel application is up-to-date. It helps in preventing duplicate styles in workbooks. If the error persists, then follow the below methods:

### **Method 1: Simplify the Workbook Formatting**

You can face the error in Excel - Too many different cell formats, if the size of your Excel file has increased due to excessive or unnecessary formatting. You can try to simplify the formatting of the affected workbook. While reducing the number of formatting combinations, you can follow the simplifying guidelines, such as using a standard font and applying borders consistently. Follow the below steps to remove unnecessary formatting in your worksheet:

- First, open the affected worksheet.
- Now, use the shortcut key (Ctrl+A) to select all the cells.
- In the Excel ribbon, navigate to the **Home** tab and click **Clear**.

![Clicking Clear in the Home tab of the Excel ribbon](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/go-to-excel-home-click-clear.jpg)

Besides this, you can try removing the cell patterns (if any) or [use cell styles](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/apply-create-or-remove-a-cell-style-472213bf-66bd-40c8-815c-594f0f90cd22) to remove unnecessary formatting in the workbook.

### **Method 2: Remove Conditional Formatting**

Conditional formatting is also one of the reasons behind the “Too many different cell formats” error. It usually occurs if you have applied multiple rules to various cells or cell ranges within a workbook. Each rule has its own formatting settings.

Here are the steps to do this:

- Open the Excel file in which you are getting the error.
- Go to the **Home** tab and locate **Conditional Formatting**.
