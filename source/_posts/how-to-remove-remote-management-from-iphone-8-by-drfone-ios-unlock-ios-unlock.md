## How to Remove Remote Management on iPhone 8 via Settings

The primary reason people want to remove remote management on iPhone is that they've acquired it from their workplace or as a second-hand purchase. If the remote management profile isn't removed, you won’t be able to use the iPhone fully. Sometimes, even a factory reset won't unlock the iPhone if the remote management is still in place.

Thankfully, if the devices are still logged in with the MDM profile credentials, you can still resolve this through the Settings menu.

How to remove Remote Management on iPhone via Settings:

- **Step 1**: Locate iPhone Settings.

Open the `"Settings"` app on your iPhone 8. Scroll until you find `"General"` from the menu and tap.

- **Step 2**: Open your profile on VPN & Device Management.

In the General Settings, open the `"VPN & Device Management"` option and tap on the profile associated with the MDM.

- **Step 3**: Check for the `"Remove"` button.

Look for a button that says `"Remove"` within the profile. If you see this button, you can proceed to remove remote management from iPhone on your own. Follow any on-screen prompts or confirmations to complete the removal process.

- **Step 4**: Contact MDM Admin if Needed:

If you do not see the `"Remove" button`, it means that you need to contact the MDM administrator for further assistance. Reach out to them to initiate the removal process.



## What Is Remote Management on iPhone 8

Providing employees with company-issued iPhones or other organizational devices has become a common practice in the corporate landscape. These devices serve as multifunctional tools, facilitating seamless communication, productivity, and access to critical business applications.

If you noticed the "Remote Management" screen on your iPhone 8, that's the manifestation of MDM at work. As we have mentioned, MDM is a security feature to oversee and control devices used by their employees. This ensures that company policies are enforced and sensitive information is protected.

MDM allows administrators to configure settings, install applications, and enforce security protocols on connected devices. They can stop you from using certain things, such as the App Store and AirDrop. MDM also handles VPN settings and lists of blocked websites.

## Activation Lock Primer

Apple products are costly, and they are prized. When a 5-year-old Android device might be left alone without anyone stealing it, you cannot risk that with an iPhone 6S, even today. Apple has built an Activation Lock in its devices to deter theft and so far, as we know, it has largely succeeded. If your iPhone 8 13 gets stolen, no one else can use it with their Apple ID unless they key in the credentials it was using previously (your credentials) and, even then, Apple has bolstered iCloud Find My Activation Lock to be more restrictive. You may have to key in a lot of information ranging from your device password (if you are also using the same Apple ID on a Mac) to your iOS device passcode too, obviously, your Apple ID password. It is a system that works in favor of Apple users.

Yet, in some cases, users want to get around the Activation Lock for genuine reasons, say, when you buy a used Apple device from someone. They may have forgotten to remove that device from their Apple account and Activation Lock would not let you use it. Or, you are an IT administrator, and you manage devices given out to employees. Some employees did not remove their accounts from their devices, and now those iPhones are riddled with Activation Lock. You can remove it using this step-by-step guide.
