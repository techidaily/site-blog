## How To Recover Data From Lost or Stolen iPhone In Easy Steps

**Summary:** Lost your iPhone and now worried about your precious data on it? This post shares how efficiently Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone can recover lost data from a lost or stolen iPhone using iCloud Backup.

_When we lose our phone, then the only thing we worry about is the valuable data stored on it. To recover all our critical data (contacts, messages, photos, videos, voice memo, etc.) all we need to do is restore them either from iTunes or iCloud backup. What if due to some unknown reasons, we are unable to access the backup? Well, in such cases we can still recover our files from the backup via Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone software._

Apple is known for its flagship features and, one of them being able to automatically backup the iPhone data. ICloud and iTunes automatically back up iPhone data and updates it whenever you sync it to your Mac. The advantage of these backup systems is that you can recover your data when your iOS device is lost or stolen.

Speaking of which, a friend of mine lost his iPhone and was looking for ways to restore his critical data. As he had saved the information by backing it up, all he had to do was transfer the information to the new iOS device. However, as luck would have it, he was unable to access the backup files either.

To get rid of the deadlock, he decided to look for a third-party application which can recover iPhone data, and after some analysis, he opted for **[iPhone Data Recovery Software](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/data-recovery-ios/)** by Stellar.
