## How to transfer contacts from OnePlus Nord N30 SE to iPhone XS/11 using Google account

Alternatively, you can import contacts to iPhone XS/11 from Gmail from your Android mobile, as well. to do that, you need to get your Gmail and Android device contacts to get synced first.

**Here is the detailed guide to transferring contacts from an Android to an iOS device.**

1. Go to your OnePlus Nord N30 SE and go to the ‘Accounts’ tab and enable syncing of contacts. ‘Settings’ > ‘Accounts’ > ‘Google’ > Turn on ‘Contacts’ switch > tap on ‘3 vertical dots’ > ‘Sync Now’.

1. Now, you need to add the same Gmail account to your iPhone X, in order to sync back contacts from it. For this, head to ‘Settings’ > ‘Passwords & Accounts’ > ‘Add Account’ > ‘Google’. Then, you’re required to punch in the details of the same Gmail account used over Android to sync contacts.

1. Open the ‘Contacts’ app and click on ‘More’. Go to the ‘Import/Export’ or simply ‘Export Contacts’ option there.
2. Click on ‘Export to SIM’ or ‘SIM card’ and then select the source of contacts i.e. ‘Phone’/’WhatsApp’/’Google’/’Messenger’.
