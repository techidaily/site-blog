1\. On both Android devices, turn on Bluetooth and pair the Oppo Find X7 Ultra devices. Navigate to the file you want to send on the source device, tap "Share," and select "Bluetooth."

2\. Now, choose the targeted device to send the file. Move to the other device and "Accept" the incoming file transfer.
