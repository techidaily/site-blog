_When we lose our phone, then the only thing we worry about is the valuable data stored on it.

As he had saved the information by backing it up, all he had to do was transfer the information to the new iOS device. However, as luck would have it, he was unable to access the backup files either.

To get rid of the deadlock, he decided to look for a third-party application which can recover iPhone data, and after some analysis, he opted for **[iPhone Data Recovery Software](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/data-recovery-ios/)** by Stellar.

When **Mac computer doesn’t recognize iPhone**, first check your USB connection. The USB cable or the port can be faulty. Try to connect iPhone to Mac using another Apple USB 2.0 cable. If that doesn’t work try with the different port. Plus, disconnect other USB devices from Mac except your iPhone.

### **3\. Restart your iPhone**

Restarting the iOS device would resolve any issue between your iPhone programs and iTunes. To restart hold volume/side/ top button depending on your iPhone model. Slide the red power off slider on your iPhone. Wait for your iPhone to turn off. After a few seconds, again restart iPhone. Now Mac should recognize your iPhone.

### **4\. Restart your Mac**

Restarting Mac clears the cache and memory of your system giving it a fresh start. It also installs pending updates.

### **5\. Update your macOS**

When **iPhone is not showing up on Mac** **Finder** but you can see it under USB Device Tree, update the macOS to the latest version. Make sure there are no pending software installs.

To check the USB Device Tree on Mac follow the below steps:

- Click on **Apple** icon followed by **About This Mac**.
- Click the **System Report** button.
- Under **Hardware**, select **USB.**

- On the right pane, you will see **USB Device Tree**. If you see your iPhone in the list, then update to the latest macOS.

### **6\. Update iTunes**

Older versions of iTunes can create conflict with normal Mac functions. Hence, Apple recommends installing the latest iTunes updates.

To install the latest iTunes, open iTunes. From the menu bar choose **Help > Check for Updates** and follow the prompts to install the latest version.

Now, check if your Mac recognizes the iPhone or not.

### **7\. Disable antivirus on Mac**

One of the reason cited for **iPhone not detected by Mac** is anti-virus or firewall protection on your system. So disable the antivirus or firewall and then try to connect your iPhone to Mac.

### **8\. Enable iOS device in Mac Preferences**

When iPhone is not showing on Mac Finder, check if your Mac Preferences allows to view iOS devices in Finder. To enable iOS device in Finder follow the below steps:

- Go to **Finder > Preferences.**
- Click on the **Sidebar** button in Finder Preferences box.
- Check in **CDs, DVDs and iOS Devices**.
