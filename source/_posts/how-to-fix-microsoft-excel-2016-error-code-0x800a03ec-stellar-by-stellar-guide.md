The error code 0x800A03EC in MS Excel can occur while exporting or importing Excel sheets to or from another application. It can occur when trying to execute a macro. It usually appears when the Excel application fails to read the queries in the VBA code, especially when using the PasteSpecial method (Range.PasteSpecial method) to paste cell data from the clipboard into an Excel sheet. It can occur if the cell data format is not compatible with the target data.

## **Causes of MS Excel Error Code 0x800A03EC**

The error code 0x800A03EC in Excel can occur in different scenarios. There could be several reasons associated with this error. Some of them are:

- Add-ins are interrupting the code operation.
- Issue with the VBA code (incorrect or incomplete queries).
- Excel file is corrupted/damaged.
- Corrupted macros.
- Trying to export large-sized Excel file which is more than the Excel’s prescribed limit.
- Outdated Excel version.
- Incompatible cell formats on source and destination (when copying/pasting cell data).
- Missing cell range (forget to specify the range while using PasteSpecial method in the VBA code).
- Trying to save Excel file to incorrect directory.
- File path contains invalid characters.

## **Solutions to Fix MS Excel Error Code 0x800A03EC**

The error 0x800A03EC can appear if your Excel file is incompatible with your Excel application version. You can run the [compatibility checker](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/save-an-excel-workbook-for-compatibility-with-earlier-versions-of-excel-169a0336-965b-4430-8554-4e7b5db79947) to review the compatibility issues in your Excel file. If this is not the issue, then follow the below methods.

### Method 1: Review VBA Code

The exception from hresult 0x800a03ec excel can occur if you are trying to execute incorrect or incomplete queries in the Excel VBA code. It can also appear if the formulas do not contain the equal (=) symbol at the beginning. Verify the VBA code for any logical flaws, typo errors, syntax errors, or missing references.

### Method 2: Check the Field Size

Excel has certain [limits and specifications](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/excel-specifications-and-limits-1672b34d-7043-467e-8e27-269d656771c3?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us). If the Excel file’s data exceeds these designated size limits, you can get the MS Excel error code 0x800A03EC error. For example, this error occurs if you try to export a file with more rows than the limit of 65536 and columns than the limit of 256. Check and optimize the file size by minimizing complex formulas and other objects.

### Method 3: Check Add-ins for Disabled Items

Sometimes, disabled items in Add-ins settings can prevent macros from functioning correctly. You can check and enable the disabled items in Add-ins using these steps:

- Navigate to **File > Options**.

![Go To Options Tab](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/go-to-options-tab.jpg)

- In **Excel Options**, click on the **Add-ins** option.
- Click the arrow corresponding to the **Manage** section.
- Select **Disabled Items** and click on the **Go** option.

![Go To Addins And Select Disabled Items](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/go-to-addins-and-select-disabled-items.jpg)

- You will see a list of disabled items.
- Click on the disabled items and then click **Enable**.
- Restart Excel for the applied changes to take effect.

### Method 4: Change Macro Settings

The error code 0x800A03EC can also occur if macros are disabled in the Macro Security settings. Follow these steps to change the macro settings in Excel:

- In MS Excel, go to **File > Options > Trust Center**.

![Click Trust Center Option](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/click-trust-center-option.jpg)

- Select **Enable all macros** and click **OK**.

### Method 5: Check the OLE Objects

The Microsoft Excel error code 0x800A03EC can also appear if there is a connection disruption in the VBA. Such an issue can occur if there is an issue with Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) in an Excel workbook. The OLE objects are linked to external files. You can check and remove the unnecessary OLE objects from your Excel file to fix the issue.

### Method 6: Check Methods in VBA

Excel can throw the “Exception from HRESULT: 0x800A03EC” error if you are trying to call an invalid method in a VBA code. Many users have reported this issue when trying to use ‘copy and paste’ feature using copy paste special [method](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/excel.range.pastespecial) (range.pastespecial) in Excel. Paste special is an advanced option in Excel to smooth the copy-and-paste task. While using this method, the exception can usually occur when Excel application detects an invalid or misaligned range or mismatch data type in the syntax. To fix this, check the syntax of the paste special method.

### Method 7: Repair your Excel File

Corruption in Excel file can create inconsistencies in the macro and lead to the “Exception from HRESULT 0x800a03ec Excel” error. In such a case, you can try repairing the Excel file using Microsoft’s inbuilt utility – Open and Repair. To use this utility, follow these steps:

- In the Excel application, go to the **File** tab and then click **Open**.
- Click **Browse** to select the Excel file in which you are getting this exception error.

## Excel Stuck at Opening File 0% - Resolve Performance Issues

**Summary:** If an Excel workbook is stuck at opening file 0%, it usually indicates a problem with the Excel file and its objects. This may happen due to Excel file corruption and a few other reasons. In this post, we have discussed these reasons along with the methods to fix and prevent ‘Excel stuck at opening file 0%’ issue.

[![Free Download for Windows](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/free-download-windows.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/ "Free Download for Windows")

When you open an Excel file (XLS/XLSX) in MS Excel, the program reads and then loads the file data along with all its objects and properties. While opening and loading an Excel file, MS Excel displays an “_Opening percentage_.” You won’t usually notice or see this Excel file opening progress percentage while accessing smaller worksheets.

It’s more noticeable when you open a large Excel file or workbook with multiple objects, formulae, formatting, etc. However, after opening an Excel file with double-click, if it is stuck at _Splash Screen_ with a message “**Opening: FileName.xlsx (0%)”** for a while (say 15-30 minutes) and does not progress, it indicates a problem with the Excel file, MS Excel program, or the system.  

![excel stuck at 0 percent](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/excel-stuck-at-opening-1024x576.png)

## Why Excel is Stuck at Opening File 0%?

If you have encountered this error, it may happen due to one of the following issues,

1. Damaged or corrupt Excel file
2. Incompatible or faulty Excel add-ins
3. Problem with the system’s display driver
4. Damaged MS Office (Excel) application

## Methods to Fix ‘Excel Stuck at Opening File 0%’ Issue

Before fixing and troubleshooting the problem, check and confirm if the Excel file is working and not corrupt. For this, you can try opening it on another PC. Now there could be two scenarios,

### **Scenario 1:  Excel File Does Not Open**

If the Excel file doesn’t open on another PC also, it indicates Excel file corruption. In such cases, look for the backup copy of the file, if you have downloaded it from an email or a website.

However, if there’s no backup, then you need an Excel file repair software, such as **Stellar Repair for Excel** to repair the corrupt file. This software preserves Excel file properties, such as cell formatting, formula bar, freeze panes, gridlines, etc. and helps you restore the damaged or corrupt worksheets to its original state with 100% integrity.

[![free download](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/free-download-1.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/)

To repair Excel file, download and launch _Stellar Repair for Excel_ software on your PC, choose the corrupt Excel (XLS/XLSX) file and click ‘**Repair’**. You can see the preview of your Excel file with all data and then save the repaired file at your desired location on the system as a new Excel file.

![stellar repair excel file](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Stellar-repair-for-excel.jpg)

### **Scenario 2: Excel File Is Accessible on Another PC**

If the Excel file opens successfully on another PC, then follow the troubleshooting methods below to resolve the Excel file stuck opening at 0%.

## Method 1: Open MS Excel in Safe Mode

To check if an incompatible or faulty add-in or setting is causing the error, restart MS Excel in safe mode and then open the worksheet from the MS Excel ‘**File**’ options. The steps are as follows,

1. Press **Windows+R** and type **excel.exe /safe**
2. Hit **Enter** or press ‘**OK**’ to open MS Excel in safe mode

![open excel in safe mode](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/run-excel-in-safe-mode.png)

- Go to **File > Open** and then choose the Excel file to open it
- If it opens, the problem is probably caused by the add-ins. Go to **File > Options > Add-ins > Manage > COM Add-ins** and disable all the third-party add-ins

![remove faulty add in from excel](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/check-and-remove-faulty-add-ins-1024x540.png)

- Restart MS Excel normally and then go to **File > Open** and open the same Excel file. If it opens, the problem is solved.

However, if you want to keep the add-ins, enable one add-in at a time and open the same file to find which add-in is causing the problem. When found, remove the faulty add-in.

If it doesn’t work, head to the next solution.

## Method 2. Disable Hardware Graphics Acceleration

If you’re using hardware graphics acceleration adapter to run an external monitor, you may encounter problems with the Excel application. If the adapter is plugged in but doesn’t work correctly, Excel will usually hang on the loading screen. To resolve this problem, you will need to disable the hardware graphics acceleration adapter by following these steps,

- Quit all running instances of Excel from **Task Manager**

![task manager to close program](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Check-task-manager.png)

- Launch MS Excel directly, don’t _double-click_ on the faulty workbook file to open MS Excel as it won’t open
- Click on **File > Options > Advanced**

![Disable hardware graphics acceleration](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Disable-hardware-graphics-acceleration.png)

- Under the ‘**Display**’ options, check the box ‘**Disable hardware graphics acceleration**’
- Click on ‘**OK**’

Try to open the Excel file now. If it still doesn’t work, move to the next solution.

## Resolve Compile Error in Hidden Module in Excel: Causes & Solutions

The hidden module in Excel refers to a container with VBA codes, custom queries, and complex macros. The compile error in a hidden (protected) module in the Excel worksheet usually occurs when doing different activities on a macro-enabled sheet, such as merging .xls files. The error can result in macros execution failure. You need to quickly resolve this compile error to restore full functionality of the VBA code. Below, we’ll be discussing the solutions to fix this Excel error. But before that, let’s see why this error occurs.

You may encounter the Compile error in hidden module due to one of the following reasons:

- The code in the workbook is not compatible with the Excel application.
- Manual queries created in a previous version are no longer compatible with your current version of Excel.
- Missing references.
- Invalid .exe files (control information cache files) are automatically created with ActiveX control insertion in Excel file.
- Protected module is corrupted.
- The workbook with hidden module is damaged or corrupted.
- Incompatible add-ins.
- Incompatible Excel file version.
- The module is protected or password-protected.
- Missing or corrupted mscomctl.ocx file.

Excel can throw the compile error while compiling the code that exists in the protected module. So, first check the error and identify the hidden module that is creating the issue. You can unprotect the module. Also, ensure that you have permission to access the VBA code in the module. If the error still exists, follow the below troubleshooting methods.

### Method 1: Re-register ActiveX Control Files or mscomctl.ocx Files

You can get the compile error in the Excel file, containing the VBA code related to ActiveX controls or OCX files. The ActiveX control files and OCX files (mscomctl.ocx files) are the components of Microsoft’s standard controls library. The compile error in the hidden module can occur if these files are missing. In this case, you can use the Regsvr32 tool to re-register the OCX files. The [Regsvr32](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/topic/how-to-use-the-regsvr32-tool-and-troubleshoot-regsvr32-error-messages-a98d960a-7392-e6fe-d90a-3f4e0cb543e5) is a command-line utility to register and unregister OLE controls in the Windows registry.

### Method 2: Delete .exd Files

 The .exd files are temporary files created by Excel when inserting ActiveX controls objects. These temporary files can lead to a compile error if they are corrupted. So, if this issue has occurred, particularly in the Excel file containing ActiveX controls, then deleting .exd files might fix the issue. To delete the .exd file, follow the below steps:

- First, open the **Run** window by pressing the Windows+R keys.

![Open The Run Window](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/open-the-run-window.jpg)

- In the **Run** window, type **%appdata%**.

![Type App Data Command](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/type-app-data-command.jpg)

- In the **Roaming** window, click on the **Microsoft** option.

![Click On Microsoft Option Under Roaming](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/click-on-microsoft-option-under-roaming.jpg)

- Under **Microsoft**, you will see a list of folders. Search and click on **Forms.**
- Right-click on a file with .exd extension and select **Delete**.
- Once you delete the .exd files, restart your Excel application.

### Method 3: Rollback the Office Updates

MS Office updates or upgrades may also cause the compile error in hidden module in Excel. If the error has occurred after downloading the recent Microsoft Office updates, try [reverting to the previous version](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/how-to-revert-to-an-earlier-version-of-office-2bd5c457-a917-d57e-35a1-f709e3dda841) or uninstalling the recent updates to fix the issue.

### Method 4: Unselect Missing References

The compile error in hidden module determine path in Excel can also occur if your file contains a reference to object library/type library, which is labelled as Missing. You can locate, check, and uncheck the references marked as ‘Missing’ to fix the issue. Here are the steps:

- Open your **Excel** and press **Alt + F11** keys.

![Unselect Missing References](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/unselect-missing-references.jpg)

- Click **OK**.

### Method 5: Check the Code in Module

The compile error in hidden module can occur if there are issues in the code within the module. The problems include incorrect or missing syntaxes, missing parameters/references, or the code contains incompatible functions or a wrong name of the object. You can check and fix these issues in the code by opening the VBA editor.

### Method 6: Check and Remove Add-ins

In Excel, the compile error in macro-enabled files can also occur due to incompatible add-ins. You can check and disable the **add-ins** in Excel using the below steps:

- First, open the **Run** window and type excel /safe and then click **OK**. The Excel application will open in safe mode.

Now, open the Excel 2010/2007 file and check if the error is fixed. If not, use the next workaround.

### **Workaround 2 – Make the Excel File 'Read-only'**

Try to open your '.xlsx' file by making it 'read-only'. Follow these steps:

- In Excel, click 'File' from the main menu.
- Select 'Save' for a new document or 'Save As' for a previously saved document in the screen that appears.

![Excel File Saving Options](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Excel-file-saving-options-image-3.png)

### **Workaround 3 – Move Excel File to a New Folder**

Some users have reported that they could open their Excel file, following the 'Excel unreadable content' error, by simply moving the file to a different folder and saving it under a new name. You can also move the affected file to a new folder and try opening it. If this didn't help resolve the error, follow the next workaround.

### **Workaround 4 – Install Visual Basic Component**

At times, it is seen that installing the 'Visual Basic' component of MS Office 2010 resolves the 'Excel found unreadable content 2010' error. To do so, follow these steps:

- Navigate to Control Panel > Programs and select Microsoft Office 2010.
