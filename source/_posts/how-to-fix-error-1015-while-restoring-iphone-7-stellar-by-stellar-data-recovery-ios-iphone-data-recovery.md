You can recover all your iMessages by connecting your iPhone to your computer, opening iTunes, and finding your backup. If the backup doesn’t recover all iMessages, you can try one of the best iMessage recovery software, Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone.

**Are deleted iMessages gone forever?**

Deleted iMessages may seem scary, but they aren’t gone forever. You can always find them in iTunes or iCloud backups. In addition, you can try the top iPhone message recovery software listed above if they’re not there.

## Why Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone takes time in scanning my iPhone?

**Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone thoroughly scans your iOS device, computer, and iCloud to retrieve every bit of data. However, the scanning time of the software** depends upon the following:

- **The amount of data in your iOS device:** Greater the amount of data on your iPhone more time it will take to scan.
- **The size of RAM on your iPhone:** Greater the RAM more will be the scanning time. For instance, the software will take more time to thoroughly scan an iPhone 12 with 6GB RAM compared to iPhone 11 that has 4GB RAM.
- **RAM of your computer:** The recommended system requirement of Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone is 8GB. Although it can scan and recover from 4GB RAM computer, but you may experience slow speed.
