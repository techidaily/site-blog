Apple has tried to address the users’ data loss issues through multiple backup solutions — iTunes, iCloud, and iCloud.com.

Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone fills in this gap really well. It not only recovers lost or deleted Calendar in situations of jailbreak, water damage, factory reset, and Black Screen of Death, etc., but also recovers specific data that you want.
