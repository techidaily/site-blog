## How to Fix iPhone Storage Not Loading/Showing

The majority of smartphones require a certain amount of storage to operate properly. When you receive a low storage message, you may instinctively check your storage space but encounter the iPhone Storage Not Loading issue.

What could be the cause of such a bothersome problem? The bad news is that the root reason for this problem is unclear, but we’ve offered some fixes you can try to fix this issue.

There is yet another way to check the storage on your iPhone if you face the “iPhone Storage Not Showing” issue, and we’ll go over it in the following section.

## How can I use a computer to check my storage?

You can check your iPhone’s storage using a computer with iTunes or Finder app installed.

- On a Mac running macOS Catalina 10.15 or later, launch the **Finder** or open **iTunes** on a PC or Mac running macOS Mojave 10.14 or an earlier version.
- You should use a cable to connect your phone and computer.
- Select your device in **iTunes** or **Finder**.
- You can see how much storage each type of content takes up by hovering your mouse over the storage bar.

![Resolve iPhone storage not loading and showing using the storage bar in iTunes](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/the-storage-bar-in-iTunes-1024x642.png)

## How can I fix iPhone Storage Not Loading/Showing?

### 1\. Wait a bit more

Some computing operations take a while to finish. Your phone’s storage may overflow with tons of app data, images, and other files if you’ve been using it for a while.

And each of them would have to load before reporting their combined size to the OS. Usually, loading takes about three minutes.

### 2\. Update iOS

If your iOS version was outdated, your phone’s functionalities, including storage access, would not function properly. Additionally, updating the OS will get rid of any potential issues. Follow the procedures listed below to check and update your iOS version:

- Select **General** from the **Settings** menu.
- Click on **Software Update**. If any updates are available, **download** and **install** them.

![Updating software to resolve iPhone storage not loading and showing ](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/software-update-process-1024x576.png)

### 3\. Force Stops the App

The settings app itself can be the problem due to an app bug. Therefore, forcing the app to close is a valid option. This will make the software restart from scratch, wiping off part of the data and information it had in RAM.

- Access the **app switcher** (swipe up your finger from the bottom of the screen to bring up the menu or double-click the **Home** button on older iPhone models).

![App switcher](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/App-switcher.png)

- Swipe up and drag the **Settings card** off the screen to force the app to close.
- Relaunch the **Settings app** to see if the problem persists.

### 4\. Reconnect to iCloud

iOS has been designed in a way that it needs to be connected to iCloud to function flawlessly. Therefore, the storage loading error could also be linked to connectivity issues between these two. In this case, signing out of the service and then back in again might resolve the issue.

- Open the **Settings** application.
- Click your profile at the top. To sign out of the service, tap **iCloud**.

![Reconnecting to iCloud settings to fix iPhone storage not loading and showing](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/iCloud-settings.png)

- Next, sign in once more using your **iCloud password**.

### 5\. Fix the Issue Using Your PC

When you connect the cable, link your iPhone to your PC, and sync the storage, iTunes looks for any issues and either fixes them on its own or recommends methods to fix them by yourself. For any software-related issues with your phone, this is a great fix, and it may even repair your iPhone storage not updating problem.

- Connect your phone to computers that have **iTunes** installed on them with a lightning cord.
- The storage data should be able to sync with your smartphone automatically.
- If not, press the **Sync** button.

### 6\. Factory Reset Your iPhone

You may fix any bugs that cause iPhone storage not to update by performing a factory reset. Furthermore, it would restore your OS version to its factory settings, resolving any problems that updates might have brought on.

The whole contents of your device will be deleted if you follow this method. You can either create a backup of your data or use a tool to restore it once your iPhone has been entirely deleted to prevent this.

- Go **Settings app** on your smartphone. Next, choose **Reset** after choosing **General**.
- Under Reset, among the few options, click **Erase all Content and Settings**.

![Earase All content to fix iPhone storage not loading and showing](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Erase-All-Content-and-Settings-option.png)

- Next, choose **Erase iPhone**. After that, your smartphone will return to its factory default settings.

### Why isn’t my iPhone storage loading?

When trying to check your iPhone’s storage, you will notice a small spinning wheel going back and forth if your phone is having storage problems since it cannot accurately represent the amount of storage that is accessible.

## How to recover deleted photos after deleting from ‘Recently Deleted’ on iPhone

The Recently Deleted folder in the Photos App on iPhone is there to recover accidentally deleted photos. However, even if your important photos are deleted from ‘Recently Deleted’ you are not yet out of luck. This post shares how to recover deleted photos after deleting them from ‘Recently Deleted’ on iPhone.

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/featured-Recover-photos-deleted-from-Recently-Deleted-on-iPhone.jpg)

_‘I deleted some important pictures on my iPhone and also deleted them from the ‘Recently Deleted’ folder. Is there any possible way to recover photos after permanently deleting them from the iPhone?’_

When you delete photos from your iPhone, they first go to the ‘Recently Deleted’ folder of the Photos App. Here the photos remain for 30 days. Hence, any picture deleted 30 days ago automatically gets removed after this period, and this time permanently.

However, sometimes you may accidentally delete valuable pictures too. To make the situation worse, even remove image files from ‘Recently Deleted’ or realize the mistake 30 days after deleting!

In any case, can you get photos back after deleting from ‘Recently Deleted’ on your iPhone?

This post addresses the problem situation of permanently deleted photos from iPhones and finds the appropriate solution.

Let’s read on…

## **Understanding permanently deleted photo recovery from iPhone**

You can recover deleted photos from your iPhone after deleting them from the Recently Deleted folder or 30 days of automatic deletion.

Of course, backups — iCloud and iTunes are the immediate go-through solution in such a case. However, Apple backups have their own disadvantage. Photo recovery with iCloud and iTunes results in the loss of your current data on your iPhone!

That’s the reason, iCloud and iTunes are frustrating when you want to get back only a few photos.

So, if you are using another backup service such as Google Drive or OneDrive for iPhone photo backup, they are more convenient.

In addition, apart from backup, iPhone recovery software is just the right solution. It works even when you don’t have a backup or don’t want to eliminate your existing data on your iPhone or iPad.

### 1\. Recover ‘Recently Deleted’ photos from iCloud backup

Use an iCloud backup to recover deleted photos from your iPhone after 30 days of deleting them from the ‘Recently Deleted’ folder. iCloud backup is the best solution to retrieve permanently deleted photos from iPhone free.

Just get on to the below steps to recover deleted photos from iCloud:

- On your iPhone, navigate to **Settings > General > Reset> Erase all Contents and Settings.**

![Erase all Contents and Settings on iphone](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-11.png)

- Select **Erase Now** in the dialog box and follow the prompts until you reach the Apps & Data screen.

![ Restore from iCloud Backup on iphone](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iphone11-ios14-apps-data-restore-from-icloud-backup.jpg)

- Sign in to your iCloud account.
- Select the recent backup from the list that has the deleted pictures. Click **Restore** to get back the deleted photos on your iPhone.

### 2\. Recover permanently deleted photos from iTunes

If you have an iTunes backup, look for the deleted photos after deleting from ‘Recently Deleted’ in your iTunes backup.

Below are the quick steps:

- Connect your iPhone to your PC or Mac and launch iTunes.
- Click on your iPhone under the device list and select the recent backup date that may contain the permanently deleted pictures.

![recover deleted photos from itunes](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2-768x276.jpg)

- Click **Restore Backup.**

That’s it. You get back the deleted photos on your iPhone.  However, this will replace the current data on the iPhone with the old backup data.

### 3\. Recover recently deleted photos from cloud storage

iPhone users, who don’t completely rely on iCloud and iTunes for backup, use third-party cloud backup solutions. If you are one of those, check your cloud storage for permanently deleted photos on your iPhone. Cloud backups such as Google Drive, iCloud, Dropbox, OneDrive, etc., are efficient ways to save and protect your photos on your iPhone from permanent loss. You can [restore photos on a PC](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/recover-permanently-deleted-photos-from-pc/), Mac, or iPhone by using cloud storage.
