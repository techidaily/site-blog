You may get into a terrible iPhone data loss situation after a factory reset, stolen iPhone, jailbreak or physical damage to your device, etc. Backup is your only resort. But another shocker is waiting for you. You cannot find iPhone backup files once saved on your Windows PC.

**Steps to find iPhone backup files on Windows PC****:**

- In the Search bar, enter _**%appdata%**_ or _**%USERPROFILE%**_ (if you downloaded iTunes from the Microsoft Store)
- Press Return
- Double-click these folders: **Apple Computer** > **MobileSync** > **Backup**
