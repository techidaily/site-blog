There is yet another way to check the storage on your iPhone if you face the “iPhone Storage Not Showing” issue, and we’ll go over it in the following section.

## How can I use a computer to check my storage?

You can check your iPhone’s storage using a computer with iTunes or Finder app installed.

- On a Mac running macOS Catalina 10.15 or later, launch the **Finder** or open **iTunes** on a PC or Mac running macOS Mojave 10.14 or an earlier version.
- You should use a cable to connect your phone and computer.

## How can I fix iPhone Storage Not Loading/Showing?

### 1\. Wait a bit more

Some computing operations take a while to finish. Your phone’s storage may overflow with tons of app data, images, and other files if you’ve been using it for a while.

And each of them would have to load before reporting their combined size to the OS. Usually, loading takes about three minutes.

### 2\. Update iOS

If your iOS version was outdated, your phone’s functionalities, including storage access, would not function properly. Additionally, updating the OS will get rid of any potential issues. Follow the procedures listed below to check and update your iOS version:

- Select **General** from the **Settings** menu.
- Click on **Software Update**. If any updates are available, **download** and **install** them.

![Updating software to resolve iPhone storage not loading and showing ](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/software-update-process-1024x576.png)

### 3\. Force Stops the App

The settings app itself can be the problem due to an app bug. Therefore, forcing the app to close is a valid option. This will make the software restart from scratch, wiping off part of the data and information it had in RAM.

- Access the **app switcher** (swipe up your finger from the bottom of the screen to bring up the menu or double-click the **Home** button on older iPhone models).

![App switcher](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/App-switcher.png)

- Swipe up and drag the **Settings card** off the screen to force the app to close.
- Relaunch the **Settings app** to see if the problem persists.

### 4\. Reconnect to iCloud

iOS has been designed in a way that it needs to be connected to iCloud to function flawlessly. Therefore, the storage loading error could also be linked to connectivity issues between these two. In this case, signing out of the service and then back in again might resolve the issue.

- Open the **Settings** application.
- Click your profile at the top. To sign out of the service, tap **iCloud**.

![Reconnecting to iCloud settings to fix iPhone storage not loading and showing](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/iCloud-settings.png)

- Next, sign in once more using your **iCloud password**.

### 5\. Fix the Issue Using Your PC

When you connect the cable, link your iPhone to your PC, and sync the storage, iTunes looks for any issues and either fixes them on its own or recommends methods to fix them by yourself. For any software-related issues with your phone, this is a great fix, and it may even repair your iPhone storage not updating problem.

- Connect your phone to computers that have **iTunes** installed on them with a lightning cord.
- The storage data should be able to sync with your smartphone automatically.
- If not, press the **Sync** button.

### 6\. Factory Reset Your iPhone

You may fix any bugs that cause iPhone storage not to update by performing a factory reset. Furthermore, it would restore your OS version to its factory settings, resolving any problems that updates might have brought on.

The whole contents of your device will be deleted if you follow this method. You can either create a backup of your data or use a tool to restore it once your iPhone has been entirely deleted to prevent this.

- Go **Settings app** on your smartphone. Next, choose **Reset** after choosing **General**.
- Under Reset, among the few options, click **Erase all Content and Settings**.

![Earase All content to fix iPhone storage not loading and showing](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Erase-All-Content-and-Settings-option.png)

Slide the red power off slider on your iPhone. Wait for your iPhone to turn off. After a few seconds, again restart iPhone. Now Mac should recognize your iPhone.

### **4\. Restart your Mac**

Restarting Mac clears the cache and memory of your system giving it a fresh start. It also installs pending updates.

### **5\. Update your macOS**

When **iPhone is not showing up on Mac** **Finder** but you can see it under USB Device Tree, update the macOS to the latest version. Make sure there are no pending software installs.

To check the USB Device Tree on Mac follow the below steps:

- Click on **Apple** icon followed by **About This Mac**.
- Click the **System Report** button.
- Under **Hardware**, select **USB.**

![USB Device Tree](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-8b4e845/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Mac-USB-tree-Image-2-1024x709.png)

<sub>Figure: USB Device Tree</sub>

- On the right pane, you will see **USB Device Tree**. If you see your iPhone in the list, then update to the latest macOS.

### **6\. Update iTunes**

Older versions of iTunes can create conflict with normal Mac functions. Hence, Apple recommends installing the latest iTunes updates.

To install the latest iTunes, open iTunes. From the menu bar choose **Help > Check for Updates** and follow the prompts to install the latest version.

Now, check if your Mac recognizes the iPhone or not.

### **7\. Disable antivirus on Mac**

One of the reason cited for **iPhone not detected by Mac** is anti-virus or firewall protection on your system. So disable the antivirus or firewall and then try to connect your iPhone to Mac.

### **8\. Enable iOS device in Mac Preferences**

When iPhone is not showing on Mac Finder, check if your Mac Preferences allows to view iOS devices in Finder. To enable iOS device in Finder follow the below steps:

- Go to **Finder > Preferences.**
- Click on the **Sidebar** button in Finder Preferences box.
- Check in **CDs, DVDs and iOS Devices**.

![Finder Preferences](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-8b4e845/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Mac-Finder-Preferences-Sidebar-Image-3-1.png)
