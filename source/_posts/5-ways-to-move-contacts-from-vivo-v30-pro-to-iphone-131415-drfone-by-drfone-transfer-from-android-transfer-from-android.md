However, most of the latest Vivo V30 Pro models are now unable to run Vivo V30 Pro Migrate since it's a pretty outdated app. It has been retired by the company since 2015. Users are seeking alternative methods for data transfer as a result. In this section, we explore more effective solutions to transfer content directly from Vivo V30 Pro to iPhone besides Vivo V30 Pro Migrate.

### Solution 1. Using ShareIt App

When Vivo V30 Pro Migrate is not an option, ShareIt can be a versatile alternative for **Vivo V30 Pro to iPhone transfer**.

If you have downloaded and installed it, you can continue with the steps below:

- **Step 1:** Connect your Vivo V30 Pro and iPhone devices

Since ShareIt operates by creating a hotspot network among devices, it's necessary to have both devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Make sure to keep both devices close to each other, too.

- **Step 2:** Select the files to transfer

On your Vivo V30 Pro device, click the "Send" button. After a new window appears displaying all the categorized files on your device, choose the specific files you want to transfer.

- **Step 3:** Look for the Vivo V30 Pro device to transfer

After selecting the files, press "Send" and provide the necessary permissions for GPS and Bluetooth. Once permissions are granted, the Vivo V30 Pro device will initiate a search for nearby devices.
