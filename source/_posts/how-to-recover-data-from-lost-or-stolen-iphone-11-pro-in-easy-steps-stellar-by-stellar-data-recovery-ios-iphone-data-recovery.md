## How To Recover Data From Lost or Stolen iPhone In Easy Steps

**Summary:** Lost your iPhone and now worried about your precious data on it? This post shares how efficiently Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone can recover lost data from a lost or stolen iPhone using iCloud Backup.

_When we lose our phone, then the only thing we worry about is the valuable data stored on it. To recover all our critical data (contacts, messages, photos, videos, voice memo, etc.) all we need to do is restore them either from iTunes or iCloud backup. What if due to some unknown reasons, we are unable to access the backup? Well, in such cases we can still recover our files from the backup via Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone software._

Apple is known for its flagship features and, one of them being able to automatically backup the iPhone data. ICloud and iTunes automatically back up iPhone data and updates it whenever you sync it to your Mac. The advantage of these backup systems is that you can recover your data when your iOS device is lost or stolen.

Speaking of which, a friend of mine lost his iPhone and was looking for ways to restore his critical data. As he had saved the information by backing it up, all he had to do was transfer the information to the new iOS device. However, as luck would have it, he was unable to access the backup files either.

To get rid of the deadlock, he decided to look for a third-party application which can recover iPhone data, and after some analysis, he opted for **[iPhone Data Recovery Software](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/data-recovery-ios/)** by Stellar.

_Is it possible to recover deleted iPhone text messages? Can I restore text messages deleted from my iPhone?_

These are some questions that are quite common among iPhone users. Smartphones, especially iPhones, have become an inseparable part of our lives. We use them to stay connected with our friends and family, stay up to date with the latest trends, stream media, and store a huge amount of photos and videos. While the newer iPhones come preloaded with a host of intelligent features to keep our data safe and backed up in a difficult situation, they are still vulnerable to data loss. We have curated a list of the 8 best iPhone data recovery software, which anyone can use to restore and recover iPhone text messages and data deleted from an iPhone or another iOS device.

## Factors to Consider While Choosing a Deleted iPhone Texts Recovery Software

Before looking at the list of the best iPhone data recovery software to recover deleted text messages, let’s take a look at various factors that one should keep in mind while choosing the right data recovery software.

![factors to consider when looking for an iPhone text recovery software](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-8b4e845/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/iPhone-Recovery-Software-1024x576.jpg)

- **Reliability** –It is best to choose an iPhone data recovery software from a reliable brand as they have the expertise to back their claim.
- **Features** – Various iPhone recovery software can recover various types of deleted data like photos, videos, messages, etc. They can also be used to perform deleted SMS recovery for recovering deleted text messages. As iPhone data is precious and important, selecting a brand that could help us recover deleted iPhone data from other sources like external storage media is wise.
- **User Reviews** – User reviews help new users and potential buyers in making their choice. Reviews are also helpful as they add to the legitimacy of software and its claims. Therefore, one should always read the reviews and select the right iPhone data recovery software.
- **Data Recovery Performance** – This is an important factor that everyone should consider before choosing the right iPhone data recovery software. Great performance always makes the software stand out from the rest. Key factors to look for are speed of data recovery, available modes of data recovery, supported file types, etc. A user should check these before choosing a data recovery software.
- **User Interface** – In this minimalistic age, a dated and complicated interface with complicated commands and menus is sure to put the users off due to a bad user experience. A simple UI enhances your user experience and enables you to use the software with ease. Hence, this is also an important factor to consider.
- **Pricing** – While most of the ‘free’ iPhone data recovery software claims to offer the best experience, the best deals offering value for the money spent are usually found amidst the list of paid software. This software not only helps the user recover deleted iPhone texts but also provides an interface to save the recovered data safely and securely post-data recovery.
