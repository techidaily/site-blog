## How to Fix the #Value! Error in Excel?

**Summary:** #Value! is a common error that occurs when using formulas in Excel. It can be due to an issue with the cells you are referencing or use of formulas in the wrong type or format. This blog will discuss some cases when this error may occur and the solutions to fix the issue. You’ll also find about an Excel repair software that can help fix the error if it has occurred due to corruption in Excel file.

You may experience the #Value! error in Excel when trying to enter invalid data type into the formulas. Sometimes, it appears when a value is not the expected type or when dates are given a text value. This Excel error may occur due to several reasons. However, the exact cause of this error is difficult to find. Below, we will be discussing some cases where you may get this error and the solutions to resolve the issues.

## Case 1: Wrong Argument Data Type in Formulas

Sometimes, Excel throws the “#Value!” error if it recognizes incompatible arguments in the formulas.

For example: The Date function in the sheet expects only numerical values as arguments. In the below image you can see that when the formula’s string value is used in the month (January), it resulted in the #VALUE! error.

![Image of #Value! error in Date Function](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/date-function-error.png)

**Solution**

To fix the issue,

- Double-click the formula to verify the type of arguments.

![Image of Solution to fix #Value! error in Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/verify-type-of-arguments-in-formulas.png)

- Correct the argument in the cell (B2).

![Image of Correcting Argument In Cell to fix #Value! error in Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/correcting-argument-in-the-cell.png)

The formula will work as expected.

## Case 2: Using the Basic Subtraction Formula

Users often experience the #Value! error, when using the basic subtraction formula in Excel.

![Image of #Value! error in Excel in Subtraction Formula ](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/subtraction-formula-error-window.png)

**Solution**

Check the formula and the type of values in the cell. If these are correct and the error persists, then follow these steps:

![Image of Correcting Basic Subtraction Formula to fix #Value! error in Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/correcting-basic-subtraction-formula.png)

- Go to the **Start** button on Windows, type **Control Panel**, and double-click on it.
- Click **Clock and Region > Region.**

![Image of Clock And Region Window in Control Panel to #Value! error in Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/clock-and-region-window.png)

- On the **Format** tab, click **Additional Settings.**

![Image of Region Window For Additional Settings](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/region-window-for-additional-settings.png)

- In the **Customized Format** window, search for **List Separator.**

![Image of Customize Format Window](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/customize-format-window.png)

- Check if the **List Separator** is set to **minus (-)**. Change it to **comma (,)**.

![Image of Apply List Seperator In Customize Format Window](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/apply-list-separator-in-customize-format-window.png)

- Click **OK.**
- Now, open the Excel file and again try to use the formula.

## Case 3: Wrong Text Value

The #Value! error can also occur due to the formula’s wrong value.

For example: If you are using the formula to add values in cells and Excel recognizes the unexpected text value, you may get a #Value error.

![Image of #Value! error in Excel because of Wrong Text Value](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/error-with-wrong-text-value.png)

**Solution**

To fix the issue, you can correct the value or use the SUM function. It is recommended to use functions instead of operations to reduce the errors. In Excel, the formulas with math operators may not able to calculate the text in the cells. The SUM function automatically ignores the text value(er), calculates everything as numbers, and displays the result without the #Value! error.

![Image of Highlighting Arguments Of-Sumfunction to fix #Value! error in Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/highlighting-arguments-of-sumfunction.png)

## Case 4: Blank Space in Cells

You may get the #Value! error if your formula refers to other cells with space or hidden space. Sometimes, spaces that make a cell display blank but actually they are not blank.

![Image of #Value! error in Excel because of Blank Space](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/errormessage-with-blank-space.png)

**Solution**

You can either delete the space or replace the blank space. Here’s how:

#### 1\. Delete the Blank Space

First, check if a cell is blank or not. To do this,

- Select the cell that looks blank.
- Press F2.

![Image of Blank cell Not Showing Space and hence the #Value! error in Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/windows-with-blankcell-not-showing-space.png)

- Open the Excel file that shows #Value! error.
- On the **Home** tab, click **Find & Select > Replace**.

![Image of Find And Select Option](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/find-and-select-option-1024x159.png)

## Case 4: Problem with Network Connection

Many users have reported experiencing errors when using Excel online due to problems with the network connection.

**Solution**

Check your Internet connection and see if it is working properly.  

## Case 5: Wrong Formula Format

If you enter the wrong formula with a missing parenthesis or comma, then Excel can throw the #Value! error. The error can also occur if the application finds a special character within a cell.

**Solution**

Correct the formula and use the ISTEXT function to find the cells with issues.  

## Case 6: Corruption in the Excel File

If none of the above works, then it indicates the Excel file is corrupt. The formulas in the Excel file do not work due to corruption.

**Solution**

You can [use the Open and Repair utility](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/repair-a-corrupted-workbook-153a45f4-6cab-44b1-93ca-801ddcd4ea53) in Excel if you are getting the error due to corruption in Excel file.

When opening a workbook in Microsoft Excel 2003 or later, you may encounter an error message,

_“Damage to the file was so extensive that repairs were not possible. Excel attempted to recover your formulas and values, but some data may have been lost or corrupted.”_

![](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-1.png)

The error message may also occur while exporting an Excel file. Let’s find out what causes this error and what we can do to fix it.

## Reasons Behind “Damage to the File Was So Extensive That Repairs Were Not Possible” Error

Your Excel file may be corrupt, oversized, virus-afflicted, etc., which can trigger this error and make the repair impossible. Below are some common reasons.

- Large or oversized excel files hindering export
- Data restore errors
- Field length of a cell is more than 256 characters
- Software conflicts, viruses, network failure
- Unable to open files in upgraded versions
- Errors on output exceeding 64000 rows
- Limited system resources (such as RAM, internal memory)

In a nutshell, the error generally happens if Excel discovers unreadable content, which may also interrupt file saving in Excel.

## How to Resolve “Damage to the File Was So Extensive That Repairs Were Not Possible” Error?

Here are a few methods you can follow to fix or resolve the Excel repair error.  

### Method 1: Perform Basic Troubleshooting

When opening a corrupt workbook, Microsoft Excel automatically initiates the file recovery mode to repair the corrupt file. However, if it fails to perform automatic recovery, then follow these basic troubleshooting steps:

- This error mainly happens when you try to open the Excel file in an upgraded version.  Try to open the file in an older version of Excel. You might be able to open it.
- Try saving the file with a different file name.
- Use a different file extension to save the file.
- You can save the Excel file as HTML and then open it. However, an HTML file might not save conditional formatting.
- Close other opened applications on the system which may be causing the error.
- Select less data for export at once.
- Delete worksheets if copied from another document; for instance, delete any file or screenshots you have imported.
- Open the file on another system.

If the error persists, then use the manual method to repair a workbook using the below steps:

- Go to the “**File**” tab.

![Go the File Tab in Excel](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-2.png)

- Select **Open** and select the damaged spreadsheet from the **Recent Workbooks** section on the right, if listed. However, if you cannot find the file in the **Recent Workbooks** section, click on “**Browse**” and choose the **corrupted workbook**.

![Click on Open and browse the corrupted workbook](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-3.png)

- Click the drop-down arrow on the **Open** tab and select **Open and Repair**.

![after selecting the corrupt excel, click on the drop-down next to Open and click on Open and Repair](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-4.png)

### Method 2: Check if exporting a Heavy File is Causing Resource Limitations in Excel

Sometimes, when you try to export an Excel sheet carrying a huge database, you may face memory errors in older Excel versions like Excel 2003. Here, you’ll have to decrease the amount of data as Excel 2003 does not permit exporting extensive data beyond a limit. However, modern versions such as Excel 2007, 2010 & 2016 allow exporting a large amount of data and utilize more RAM than the older versions.

Following are some other workarounds:

- Use a lesser number of query presentation fields to re-generate the query. Then, again re-enter those fields.
- Decrease the multi-line string field data text up to 8000 characters.

### Method 3: Copy Macros and Data to Another Workbook (Empty) in an Advanced Excel version

If the issue is occurring due to version incompatibility, i.e., if the file opens easily in the older version but shows errors in the new version. You can:

**Use the older version to open the file or copy the data or macros in an empty workbook of the new version of Excel.**  

#### Copying the Macros in the Workstation

In Microsoft Excel, you can use the **Visual Basic Editor** to open the workbook with macro on another workbook by copying the macro. Both VBA tools and Macros appear in the Developer section of the excel file. This option is disabled by default. So first, you need to enable it.

Follow the instructions to enable it:

- Open Excel and go to **File** > **Options.**

## How to fix runtime error 424 object required error in Excel

The Runtime error 424: Object required occurs when Excel is not able to recognize an object that you are referring to in a VBA code. The object can be a workbook, worksheet, range, variable, class, macro, etc. Some users have also reported that this error occurred when they tried to copy the values of the cells from one workbook to another.

Let’s understand the error through a small scenario. Suppose, I want to check the last field row in a table in a spreadsheet named “First” using the VBA code. To do this, I have added a command button and double-clicked on it and entered the below code in the backend:

Private Sub CommandButton2\_Click()

Dim LRow As Integer

LRow = Worksheets("First").Cells(Rows.Count, 2).End(xlUp).Row

MsgBox ("Last Row " & LRow)

End Sub

![Code On Command Button](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/Error424/code-on-commandbutton.jpg)

In this code, _Worksheets("First")_ is a data object. If I mistakenly delete this data object and insert any random name (for example - kanada), then it will not be recognized by Excel. When I run this code, I will get the “Run-time error 424”.

![Runtime Error with scenario](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/Error424/run-time-error-424-with-scenario.jpg)

## **Causes of Runtime Error 424 in Excel**

The Runtime error 424: Object required can occur due to the following reasons:

- Incorrect name of the object you are trying to refer to in a code.
- You have provided an invalid qualifier to an object.
- You have not used the Set statement while assigning an object reference.
- The object is corrupted.
- Missing objects in a workbook.
- Objects you are trying to call in a code are mistakenly deleted or unavailable.
- You have used an incorrect syntax for object declaration.
- You are trying to perform an invalid action on an object in a code.
- Workbook is corrupted.

##  **Solutions to Fix Runtime Error 424: Object Required in Excel**

The VBA error ‘object required’ may occur due to different reasons. Based on the reason, you can follow the solutions mentioned below to fix the error.

### **1\. Check the Name of the Object**

The Runtime error 424 can occur when you run the VBA code using an incorrect name of the object. For example, the object name is ‘MyObject’ but you’re using “Backcolor”.

![Error When Incorrect Name Of The Object](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/Error424/error-424-when-incorrect-name-of-the-object.jpg)

 When you click the **Debug** button, the line with the error will highlight.

![Highlighting Line With Error](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/Error424/highlighting-line-with-error.jpg)

To fix the issue, you need to provide the correct name of the object.

### **2\. Check if the Object is Missing**

 The Runtime error 424 can occur if the object you are referring to as a method is not available or you are using the wrong object in a code. In the below example, you can see that the error occurs when an object named “Employee” is not available in the Project list.

![Example Of Code When Object Is Not Available](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/Error424/example-of-code-when-an-object-is-not-available.jpg)

 You can check and mention the object which is available. For instance, Sheet2 in the below code.  

![Check When The Object Is Available](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/Error424/check-when-the-object-is-available.png)

### **3\. Check All References are Declared in the Code**

You can get the Runtime error 424 if all the references are not declared. So, make sure you have declared all the references in the code. To verify this, you can use the debug mode by pressing **F5** or clicking on the **Debug** option.

![Debug Command In Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/Error424/debug-command-in-excel.jpg)

### **4\. Check the Macro Security Settings**

- On the **Developer** tab, in the **Code** section, click **Macro Security**.
- In the **Trust Center** window, select **Enable all macros.**

![Macro Security Wizard](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/Error424/macro-security-wizard.jpg)

[![Free Download for Windows](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/free-download-windows.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/ "Free Download for Windows")

MS Excel is equipped with several brilliant features and functions which make working with large volumes of data easy. In addition to helping users save data into well-organized cells and tables, the application helps users draw inferences from the data. Pivot Table is one such Excel feature that helps users extract the gist from a large number of rowed data. But often, the Pivot table may get corrupted and lead to unexpected errors or data loss.

**Corrupt Pivot Tables** can stop users from reopening previously saved Excel workbooks, raising the serious issue of data inaccessibility. Resolving such issues is an uphill task unless one gets to the actual root cause of the problem.

_However, with Stellar Repair for Excel software, you can **repair the corrupt Pivot table of MS Excel file** while keeping the Excel file data, formatting, layout, etc. intact._

![Repair Corrupt Pivot Table of MS Excel File](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1-2.jpg)

## **Excel Pivot Tables & Associated Problems**

Pivot Tables in Microsoft Excel are created by applying an operation such as sorting, averaging, or summing to the data in certain tables. The results of the operation are saved as summarized data in other tables. Typically, working on the grouping of saved data, Pivot Tables are used in data processing and are found in data visualization programs, such as spreadsheets or business intelligence software.

Put simply, Pivot Tables in Excel allow you to extract the significance or the gist from a large, detailed data set by allowing you to slice-and-dice data, sort-and-filter data, or arrange it in any way you want.

## Frequently Encountered Problems with Pivot Tables in MS Excel

Take a look at the most frequently encountered **Pivot Table issues**:

- You add **new data into a pivot table** but it doesn’t show up when you refresh
- **Pivot Table contains Blanks** instead of Zeros for fields that have no source data
- **Automatic field names assigned** by the Pivot Table can be inappropriate
- It doesn’t directly **show the percentage of total**
- **Grouping** one pivot table affects another
- Your **number of formatting gets lost**
- Refreshing a pivot table **messes up column widths**
- Field headings make no sense and **add clutter**

While some of the above problems seem minute and can easily be resolved using a few tweaks, bigger issues like unexpected Pivot Table error messages that an Excel throws can be troublesome.

## **Pivot Table Errors & Their Reasons**

Excel users who have built new Pivot Tables in Excel often report the following errors when trying to reopen a previously saved workbook:

_**We found a problem with some content in <filename>. Do you want us to try to recover as much as we can? If you trust the source of this workbook, click Yes.**_

![Pivot Table Corruption error in Excel File](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1-3.png)

Naturally, users are prompted to click on ‘**Yes**’. But when they do, they get another error message saying:

_**Removed Part: /xl/pivotCache/pivotCacheDefinition1.xml part with XML error**_

_**(PivotTable cache) Load error. Line 2, column 0**_

_**Removed Feature: PivotTable report from /xl/pivotTables/pivotTable1.xml part (PivotTable view)**_

Such errors are indicative of the fact that the **data within the Pivot Table still exists**, but the table itself isn’t functioning anymore.

There could be two primary reasons behind such behavior:

- You’ve **created the Pivot Table in an older version** of Excel but are trying to open-refresh-save it through a newer Excel version
- The **Pivot Table itself is corrupted**

## **How to Repair the Pivot Table Quickly?**

To solve the errors associated with Pivot Tables, you need to repair them. But Microsoft doesn’t offer any inbuilt technique or option to repair Pivot Tables. Thus, to fix the issue, you either need some sort of workaround or an [Excel file repair software](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/).

## **Methods to Fix Corrupt Pivot Table in MS Excel**

Though there aren’t many options to fix the Pivot Table, you can follow these workarounds to try and repair a corrupt Pivot Table of MS Excel. However, before following these steps, create a backup copy of your Excel file.

### **Method 1: Open MS Excel in Safe Mode**

First, try opening the [Excel file in safe mode](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/open-office-apps-in-safe-mode-on-a-windows-pc-dedf944a-5f4b-4afb-a453-528af4f7ac72) and then check if you can access the Pivot Table. If you can, save all its contents to a new Pivot Table in the latest version of Excel so that this problem doesn’t arise anymore.

### **Method 2: Use Pivot Table Options**

If, however, above method doesn’t work, follow the below-mentioned steps:

- Right-click on the **Pivot Table** and click on **Pivot Table Options**
- On the Display tab, clear the checkbox labeled “**Show Properties in ToolTips**”
- Save the file (.xls, .xlsx) with the new settings intact

### **Method 3: Make Changes to Pivot Table**

If the above method or steps didn’t work,

- Try opening the **Pivot Table Options** window by right-clicking on the Pivot Table within your Excel file
- Select Pivot Table Options from the pop-up menu and make appropriate changes to the options given there
- Then check if the issues go away

### **Method 4: Check and Set Data Source**

If the problem in the Pivot table is related to data refresh,

- Go to **Analyze > Change Data Source**
- Check if the data source is set properly
- Also, try reselecting the data source and check if the refresh option is working properly

If not, resorting to **Stellar Repair for Excel** software might be your only hope.
