## Simple Reminders to Copy Contacts From Vivo Y17s to iPhone Smoothly

It’s true to say that the five data transfer methods above are safe and effective. But generally speaking, we can’t deny that any process that involves the migration of data is sensitive in nature. That’s why it’s important to prepare both devices before officially initiating the data transfer process. Here are some reminders you need to keep in mind before you export contacts from Vivo Y17s to iPhone.

- Make sure your iPhone is fully charged and carrying enough internal storage.
- Incoming phone calls might interrupt the data transfer process in some ways. Hence, it’s best to turn the Airplane mode on both devices while the contacts are being migrated.
- Don’t use both devices once the data transfer has started.
- Lastly, create a backup file for your contact list. You never know what’s going to happen with the transfer. It’s best to be prepared to avoid data loss. Don’t worry. [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/)has a file backup feature that can help you a lot.

## Conclusion

Data transfer is a sensitive procedure. That’s why it’s highly recommended to opt for a conservative yet effective migration method to prevent serious issues. The five techniques above can surely help you copy contacts from Vivo Y17s to iPhone 14 or any model. Just make sure to prepare your mobile devices beforehand and settle on the data transfer option suitable to your needs. For a more convenient phone transfer solution, install Wondershare Dr.Fone on your computer. It is equipped with data migration features that can help you export contacts from Vivo Y17s to iPhone securely.
