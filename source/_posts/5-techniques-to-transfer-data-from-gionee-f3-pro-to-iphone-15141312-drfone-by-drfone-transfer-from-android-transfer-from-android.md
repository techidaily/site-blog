## 5 Techniques to Transfer Data from Gionee F3 Pro to iPhone 15/14/13/12

It comes as no surprise that the new iPhone 15 series is turning heads and making a splash worldwide. Well, why not?

Switching to a brand-new smartphone requires plenty of work. You first need to set up the new device and configure your digital accounts. But with regard to data transfer and file synchronization, you don’t have to worry a lot. There are many ways you can try to quickly **transfer data from Gionee F3 Pro to iPhone 15.**

In this article, we’ll talk about the essential factors involved in data migration of two devices with different operating systems. We will also provide a few tutorials on how to **transfer data from Gionee F3 Pro to iPhone 15** conveniently. Continue reading below to learn more.


## Factors to Consider When Transferring Data From Gionee F3 Pro to iPhone

It’s probably true to say that data migration is a major procedure. It’s not just a simple file-sharing method that can be completed in no time. A lot of things are involved when data is transferred from one device to another. To help you understand it better, below is a list of factors affecting the quality and speed of data migration.

### File Size

The size of files being transferred affects the process in general. This is because the Gionee F3 Pro device on the receiving end needs to allocate the data individually to the available space. That’s why the procedure often takes some time to complete if the volume of files is quite large. On the hand one hand, data migration gets completed in a snap if the file size is smaller.

### File Type

The type of files involved in the data transfer is also a factor. Why so? The simplest explanation is that compatibility matters a lot in any form of file transfer. For instance, the procedure will likely fail if the receiver’s device does not support the data you’re trying to send. But don’t worry. There are lots of methods to transfer data from Gionee F3 Pro to iPhone 15 if your first try doesn’t work out.

### Device Storage

Device storage is definitely the first thing you should check before going ahead with the data transfer. It is important that the receiver’s device has adequate memory to accommodate the incoming files. Otherwise, the transfer will likely not push through.

### Operating Systems

Migrating files between two smartphones with the same operating system is convenient. It’s because these two devices share an identical data-sharing structure. On the one hand, data migration between two smartphones with different operating systems is almost similar to the former. It’s just that the steps for the latter are quite longer. But don’t sweat it. There are many tutorials that can help you transfer data from Gionee F3 Pro to iPhone 15 conveniently.

## Troubleshoot Why I Can’t Transfer Texts from Gionee F3 Pro to iPhone

Even with the reliable methods mentioned earlier, there may be instances where you encounter difficulties in transferring texts from your Android to your iPhone. Don't worry; we've got you covered with solutions to common issues that might hinder a smooth transfer.

- **1\. Interrupted transfer**

The transfer process may be interrupted if you use other apps, receive a phone call, or navigate away from the transfer screen on your Gionee F3 Pro before it completes. So, make sure that both devices are left undisturbed until the transfer process is complete.

If you navigate away from the "Move to iOS" app on your Android or receive a phone call during the transfer, it may disrupt the process. Restart the transfer and keep both devices active until completion.

- **2\. Problems with Wi-Fi connection**

Wi-Fi connection issues on the Android device can hinder the transfer process. This may be caused by apps or settings affecting Wi-Fi, such as Sprint Connections Optimizer or the Smart Network Switch.

To address it, you can turn off apps or settings that might affect Wi-Fi on your Gionee F3 Pro, forget known Wi-Fi networks, and retry the transfer. It’s important to maintain a stable Wi-Fi connection on both devices throughout the transfer.

- **3\. Partial content transfer or iOS device full message**

Users may encounter situations where only some content is transferred, or the iOS device appears full despite an incomplete transfer. This can lead to potential data loss.

For this issue, you can consider erasing your iOS device and starting the transfer again. Make sure that the available space on your iPhone accommodates the Android content. Delete unnecessary data or apps on your iPhone to free up space if needed.

## Bonus: How to Back Up Messages with Google Drive

In addition to seamless transfers between devices, backing up your text messages becomes equally important. Fortunately, Google Drive offers a convenient solution by allowing you to back up your messages with ease. Turning on backup on Google Drive ensures that your valuable SMS history remains safe and accessible whenever you need it.

- **Step 1:** Open your Gionee F3 Pro’s Settings. Start by opening your Android "Settings" and navigate to the "System," "System & Updates," or "About phone" section.

Google Drive may limit you to 15 GB of free storage, but it’s among the best Google apps for sharing files across devices. You may already use its desktop version to collaborate on docs and spreadsheets, so why not leverage its handy mobile app?

### 6\. Transfer Data Using a USB Cable

USB cables—the unsung heroes of connectivity. Like Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, we can’t imagine life without them. They’re perfect for transferring data between devices.

However, in this instance, we don’t mean the traditional data transfer between your phone and computer (we’ll get to that shortly). This trick involves connecting your old Android phone to your new Samsung Galaxy S23 with a USB cable.

It’s almost like Samsung’s Smart Switch, except you don’t need to download an app and can move more data. You can transfer everything from your old Android device’s internal storage to your new smartphone. Here’s how:

1. Connect your phones using a USB-C to USB-C cable. Your Samsung Galaxy S23 came with it.

![connecting phones with a usb cable](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-12.jpg)

2. Tap **Connected to Android**on your Galaxy S23 phone and select **MTP Host** (Media Transfer Protocol).

![establishing a usb connection](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-13.jpg)

3. Tap **Allow**on your old Android to enable data access.

![allowing data access](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-14.jpg)

4. Choose the desired file manager on your new phone and browse your old Android’s internal storage.

![accessing android data](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-15.jpg)

5. Choose folders or files to transfer, tap the **kebab menu**for more options, and select **Copy to**.

![choosing data to transfer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-16.jpg)

6. Pick any location on your Samsung S23 phone (e.g., the **Downloads**folder for quick access) and tap **Copy**.

Moving data between phones using a USB cable is faster than Bluetooth but offers the same functionality. However, charge your devices beforehand because the data transfer may take a while (if you have many sizable files).

### 7\. Use an SD Card

We can almost see you fumbling with your Samsung S23, looking for an SD or microSD card slot. Newsflash: there isn’t one. Like its predecessors, S21 and S22, the Galaxy S23 series doesn’t support expandable storage.

How can you transfer data from an SD card, then? Well, there’s always your computer. You can migrate your SD card data to your desktop or laptop before moving it to your new Galaxy phone.

It may not be as straightforward as the methods above, but it’s ideal for keeping precious files from your old Android’s SD card. Here’s what to do:

1. Select the desired files or folders on your old Android, tap **Move**, and choose your **SD card**.

![moving files to an sd card](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-18.jpg)

2. Connect the Android to your computer with a USB cable.
3. Tap **USB for file transfer**in the **Notification panel** and select **Transferring files / Android Auto**.

![choosing a usb for file transfer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-19.jpg)

4. Go to **This PC**in **File Explorer** and open your phone under **Devices and drives**.
5. Right-click the folders or files you wish to move, select **Copy**, and paste them to any location on your computer.

![transferring files to a pc](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-android-to-samsung-s23-20.jpg)

6. Once you move the data, safely disconnect your old Android and connect your Samsung S23 to the PC.
7. Go to the folder with your newly saved data and copy-paste it to your Samsung S23.

This method is best for transferring photos, videos, and other files from an SD card you might not use anymore. After all, smartphone manufacturers increasingly ditch SD card slots for sleek, more compact designs.

## Conclusion

Switching from Gionee F3 Pro to Samsung S23 is a breeze because you have many data transfer options. Besides Samsung’s Smart Switch, you can use your synced Google Account, Google Drive, Bluetooth, or a USB-C to USB-C cable. You can also migrate data from your old Android SD card to your computer before transferring it to your new phone.

However, Wondershare Dr.Fone Phone Transfer might be your best option. Besides transferring files, it features many tools for seamless phone management, making it a fantastic addition to your digital toolbox.
