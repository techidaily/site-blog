- **Step 2**: Backup iDevice If Needed

A prompt will appear asking you to [back up your iOS device data](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-backup-and-restore/) before executing this process, as the process normally erases the data of the device. Click **Continue** if you do not bother with the erasing of your data.
