### **Recover your data from iCloud Backup**

Another effective way to recover data from broken iPhones is through iCloud Backup. For any reason, let’s suppose you cannot access your iCloud backup files; then, using the ‘**Recover from iCloud Backup**’ feature, you can restore all your essential files. The simple steps are as follows:

1. Click ‘**Recover from iCloud Backup**.’
2. Sign in to your iCloud account to view the list of available backup files.
3. In the left pane, click on the supported file list categories to view files under them.
4. Select the files that you wish to restore and click ‘Save.’

**Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone** recovers the deleted photos, contacts, messages, etc., from the backup files and restores them to the device.

**That’s Not All**

Apart from recovering data from damaged iPhones, Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone facilitates the option to import the recovered files to your new or fixed iPhone.

To import your recovered files, follow these steps:

1. First, connect your iPhone to the system, run the software, and click the ‘**Import file to iPhone**’ option.
2. Click ‘**Browse**’ and select the files you wish to import to your iPhone.
3. Click ‘**OK**’ to preview the selected files.
4. Click ‘**Transfer to iPhone**’ to transfer recovered files to your iPhone.

## **To Sum Up**

When your iPhone is damaged, try the basics, i.e., restart it; if that works, back up as much data as possible. You can also restore your files from iTunes or iCloud Backup if there are any. Else, make an appointment with the genius bar and get your iPhone fixed. They might also help you recover data from the damaged iPhone, which comes with an asterisk. Therefore, turn to Stellar Data Recovery and save time and energy for efficient recovery of your data.
