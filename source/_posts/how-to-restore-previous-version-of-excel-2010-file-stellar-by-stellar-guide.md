## \[Fixed\] The Workbook Cannot Be Opened or Repaired By Microsoft Excel

An MS Excel workbook (.XLS/.XLSX) file may not open due to damage or corruption caused by various reasons, such as:

- Sudden power failure
- System crash
- Virus or malware intrusion
- Large or oversized Excel file
- Incompatible add-ins

## **Methods to Fix 'The Workbook Cannot Be Opened' Error**

When an Excel workbook gets corrupt, MS Excel automatically detects and starts the file recovery mode to open and repair the file. However, when it fails to repair the corruption or recover the Excel file automatically, it displays the error message, "_The workbook cannot be opened or repaired by Microsoft Excel because it is corrupt_." In such a situation, you can follow these methods to repair and recover the Excel document manually.

If the manual methods fail to resolve the error, you can use an Excel repair software, such as Stellar Repair for Excel. The software repairs corrupt XLS/XLSX file, recovers all the data, and saves it in a new Excel document with 100% precision, while keeping the cell formatting and properties intact.

## Solutions to open Excel Read Only Documents

'Excel cannot open read-only documents' is an error message that usually appears when you try to open an Excel (**XLS** or **XLSX**) file downloaded from the Internet, email, or the network server. It may also appear when you try to open an encrypted or password-protected Excel document. In such a case, MS Excel prevents the user from making any changes to the document.

![error message](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/error-message-1-1.png)

## Reasons behind the “Excel cannot access 'xxx.xls.' The Document may be read-only or encrypted” Error

There could be several reasons that may cause the error. Some of them are as follows:

- Corrupt or damaged Excel workbook
- Incompatible or unsupported add-in
- Antivirus or malware software conflict
- Read-Only Excel file
- The file is encrypted
- File or drive read/write permissions issues
- Protected Excel workbook
- Damaged or missing MS Office (MS Excel) program files

## Solutions to Open and Edit Read-Only Excel Documents

Below are a few solutions that can help you fix the 'Excel cannot access 'xxx.xls.' The Document may be read-only or encrypted' error and allow you to open and edit Excel documents.

- **Remove Read-only Attribute from Excel File Properties**

The 'Excel cannot open read-only documents' error message may appear when the Excel file property is set to read-only. To check if this is the case, follow these steps:

- Right-click on the particular Excel (xls/xlsx) document and select '**Properties'.**
  - Uncheck the '**Read-only'** attribute and then click the '**OK'** button.

![Illustrates the 'Read-only' attribute in Excel XLSX document](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/read-only-properties-2.jpg)

Now try to open the Excel document and check if the problem is fixed.

- **Adjust Antivirus Settings**

A few antivirus programs block Excel files and other Office documents by opening those in 'read-only' mode. In such cases, try adjusting the antivirus settings to open the Excel files normally. This will allow you to edit, modify, and save the Excel workbook without encountering the “Excel cannot access 'xxx.xls.' The Document may be a read-only or encrypted” error message.

- **Disable Protected-View**

The error may appear when you try to open an Excel file received as email attachments or downloaded from unsafe source. The file may potentially contain viruses, worms, or other types of malware that could damage the system or the server.

To safeguard the system, MS Excel opens such files in **Protected View**. It may also open an Excel workbook in Protected Mode when it detects a problem with the file. This security feature allows you to read or view Excel files and reduces the risks to the computer system or PC.

However, you can click **File > Info** and then click '**Edit Anyway**' to access and edit file content. You may also disable the **Protected View** setting via **_File > Options > Trust Center > Trust Center Settings…> Protected View._** However, we do not recommend this.

![Protected View](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Protected-view-3.png)

- **Renew/Activate Microsoft Office**

If MS Office is in a deactivated state or its subscription has expired, the Office documents, including the Excel, could be in 'read-only reduced functionality mode.'

In such a scenario, activate Microsoft Office or renew the Office subscription. Then open the Excel workbook and check if the problem of 'Excel cannot open read-only documents' is resolved.

- **Check if OneDrive Storage is Full**

If Excel files are saved on OneDrive with low or no storage space, you may encounter such issues with your files.

To know the amount of free space on OneDrive, follow these steps:

- On your PC, open **Settings** and navigate to OneDrive.
  - Click '**Sync Settings > File Storage**' to see available space.

You may also visit onedrive.live.com, sign in to the account, and then check the available space. If there's no space available or the drive is full, empty the storage space and see if the problem is resolved.

- **Check and Update MS Office and Windows**

Microsoft releases updates to fix known errors. Thus, it is critical to update both Windows and MS Office to the latest release and avoid issues, such as 'Excel cannot access 'xxx.xls.' The Document may be read-only or encrypted.'

- **Repair MS Office (MS Excel)**

The error 'Excel cannot open read-only documents' may appear due to a problem with your MS Office (MS Excel) program. You can repair the MS Office program to resolve such errors. The steps are as follows:

- Open Control Panel and click **Uninstall a Program** link under **Programs.**
- Choose Microsoft Office from the list and click the **Change** button.

![Change button](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/repair-ms-office-4.png)

- Select Quick Repair and then click Repair to fix problems with MS Office and MS Excel. It will also restore any missing or damaged program files.

![Quick Repair and then click Repair to fix problems](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/quick-repair-ms-office-5.png)

After the Repair, open the Excel workbook and check if the error is resolved.

- **Check Permissions**

The error message may also appear if you access an Excel workbook from a network or shared drive due to lack of write permission. Make sure you have read and write permissions assigned for the particular network drive. Alternatively, you can copy the file from the network drive and save it in your local folder to access and edit it without encountering this error message.

- **Repair MS Excel File**

If none of the solutions worked, the Excel workbook could be damaged or corrupt. To repair such damaged Excel workbook or spreadsheet, you can use the inbuilt '**Open and Repair…**’ option in MS Excel or install an **[Excel repair software](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/)**, such as Stellar Repair for Excel. The software comes in handy when the **Open and Repair** option fails to fix the Excel workbook problems. It repairs the corrupt or damaged Excel workbook, extracts all components and content from the file with 100% integrity, and saves them in a new Excel workbook.

## Conclusion

Sometimes, the 'Excel cannot open read-only documents' error can be resolved by a simple restart. But if it doesn't work, you can follow the solutions discussed in this article to resolve the 'Excel cannot open read-only documents' issue.  However, if the issue is caused due to a damaged or corrupt Excel workbook, these methods may not work. In such a case, you can use Excel's inbuilt repair utility, i.e., **Open and Repair,** or install Stellar Repair for Excel software recommended by **MVPs** and **industry experts** to fix all kinds of problems with MS Excel workbooks.

![open-other-workbooks](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/open-other-workbooks-img3.png)

- Click the **Recover Unsaved Workbooks** button at the bottom of the ‘Recent Workbooks’ section.

![recover-unsaved-workbook](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/recover-unsaved-workbook-img4.png)

- A window with list of unsaved Excel files will open. Click the corrupt file you want to open.

This will reopen your last saved version of the Excel workbook. If this method doesn’t work, proceed with the next workaround.

### **Workaround 2 – Revert to Last Saved Version of your Excel File**

If your Excel file gets corrupt in the middle of making any changes, you can recover the file’s data if the changes haven’t been saved. For this, you need to revert to the last saved version of your Excel file. Doing so will discard any changes that may have caused the file to turn corrupt. Here’s how to do it:

- In your Excel 2016 file, click **File** from the main menu.
- Click **Open**. From the list of workbooks under Recent workbooks, double-click the corrupt workbook that is already open in Excel.
- Click **Yes** when prompted to reopen the workbook.

Excel will revert the corrupt file to its last saved version. If it fails, skip to the next workaround.

### **Workaround 3 – Save the Corrupted Excel File in Symbolic Link (SYLK) Format**

Saving an Excel file in SYLK format might help you filter out corrupted elements from the file. Here are the steps to do so:

- From your Excel **File** menu, choose **Save As**.
- In ‘Save As’ window that pops-up, from the **Save as type** dropdown list, choose the **SYLK (Symbolic Link)** option, and then click **Save**.

![symbolic link format](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/save-as-symbolic-link-format-img5.png)

**_Note:_** _Only the active sheet will be saved in workbook on choosing the SYLK format._

- Click **OK** when prompted that “The selected file type does not support workbooks that contain multiple sheets”. This will only save the active sheet.

![Workbooks contain multiple sheets warning msg](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/Workbooks-contain-multiple-sheets-warning-msg-img6.png)

- Click **Yes** when the warning message appears - “Some features in your workbook might be lost if you save it as SYLK (Symbolic Link)”.

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/Excel-message-img7.png)  

- Click **File** > **Open**.
- **Browse** the corrupt workbook saved with SYLK format (.slk) and open it.
- After opening the file, select **File** > **Save As**.
- In ‘Save as type’ dialog box, select Excel workbook.
- Rename the workbook and hit the **Save** button.

After performing these steps, a copy of your original workbook will be saved at the specified location.

How to Recover Corrupted Excel File 2016 Data When You Cannot Open the File?

If you can’t access the Excel file, apply one of these workarounds to salvage the file’s data.

### **Workaround 1 – Open and Repair the Excel File**

Excel automatically initiates ‘File Recovery’ mode on opening a corrupt file. After starting the auto-recovery mode, it attempts to reopen and repair the corrupt Excel file at the same time. If the auto-recovery mode does not start automatically, you can try to fix corrupted Excel file 2016 manually by using ‘Open and Repair’. Follow these steps:

- Open a blank file, click the **File** tab and select **Open**.
- **Browse** the location where the corrupt 2016 Excel file is stored.
- When an ‘Open’ dialog box appears, select the file you want to repair.
- Once the file is selected, click the arrow next to the **Open** button, and then click the **Open and Repair** button.
- Do any of these actions:
- Click **Repair** to fix corrupted file and recover data from it.
- Click **Extract Data** if you cannot repair the file or only need to extract values and formulas.

![repair excel file](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/repair-excel-file-img8.jpg)

If performing these actions doesn’t help you retrieve the data, proceed with the next workaround.

### **Workaround 2 – Disable the Protected View Settings**

Follow these steps to disable the protected view settings in an Excel file:

- Open a blank 2016 workbook.

![disable-protected-view-settings](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/disable-protected-view-settings.png)

Now, try opening your corrupt Excel 2016 file. If it won’t open, try the next workaround.

### **Workaround 3 – Link to the Corrupt Excel File using External References**

If you only need to extract Excel file data without formulas or calculated values, use external references to link to your corrupt Excel 2016 file. Here’s how you can do it:

- From your Excel file, click **File** > **Open**.
- From the window that opens, click **Computer** and then click **Browse** and copy the name of your corrupt Excel 2016 file. Click the **Cancel** button.

![browse corrupted excel file](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/browse-corrupted-excel-file-img13.png)

- Go back to your Excel file, click **File** > **New** > **Blank workbook**.

![new excel workbook](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/new-excel-workbook-img14.png)

- In the new Excel workbook, type “=CorruptExcelFile Name!A1” in cell A1 to reference cell A1 of the corrupted file. Replace the ‘CorruptExcelFile Name’ with the name of the corrupt file that you have copied above. Hit **ENTER**.
- If ‘Update Values’ dialog box appears, select the corrupt 2016 Excel file, and then click **OK**.
- If ‘Select Sheet’ dialog box pops-up, select a corrupt sheet, and press the **OK** button.
- Select and drag cell A1 till the columns required to store the data of your corrupted Excel file.
- Next, copy **row A** and drag it down to the rows needed to save the file’s data.
- Select and copy the file’s data.
- From the **Edit** menu, choose the **Paste Special** option and then select **Values**. Click **OK** to paste values and remove the reference links to the corrupt file.

Check the new Excel file for recoverable data. If this didn’t work, consider using an [Excel file repair tool](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/) to retrieve data.
