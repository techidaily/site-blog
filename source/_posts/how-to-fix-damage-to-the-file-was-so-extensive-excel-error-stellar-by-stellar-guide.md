The error message may also occur while exporting an Excel file. Let’s find out what causes this error and what we can do to fix it.

## Reasons Behind “Damage to the File Was So Extensive That Repairs Were Not Possible” Error

Your Excel file may be corrupt, oversized, virus-afflicted, etc., which can trigger this error and make the repair impossible. Below are some common reasons.

- Large or oversized excel files hindering export
- Data restore errors
- Field length of a cell is more than 256 characters
- Software conflicts, viruses, network failure
- Unable to open files in upgraded versions
- Errors on output exceeding 64000 rows
- Limited system resources (such as RAM, internal memory)

In a nutshell, the error generally happens if Excel discovers unreadable content, which may also interrupt file saving in Excel.

## How to Resolve “Damage to the File Was So Extensive That Repairs Were Not Possible” Error?

Here are a few methods you can follow to fix or resolve the Excel repair error.  

### Method 1: Perform Basic Troubleshooting

When opening a corrupt workbook, Microsoft Excel automatically initiates the file recovery mode to repair the corrupt file. However, if it fails to perform automatic recovery, then follow these basic troubleshooting steps:

- This error mainly happens when you try to open the Excel file in an upgraded version.  Try to open the file in an older version of Excel. You might be able to open it.
- Try saving the file with a different file name.
- Use a different file extension to save the file.
- You can save the Excel file as HTML and then open it. However, an HTML file might not save conditional formatting.
- Close other opened applications on the system which may be causing the error.
- Select less data for export at once.
- Delete worksheets if copied from another document; for instance, delete any file or screenshots you have imported.
- Open the file on another system.

If the error persists, then use the manual method to repair a workbook using the below steps:

- Go to the “**File**” tab.

![Go the File Tab in Excel](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-2.png)

- Select **Open** and select the damaged spreadsheet from the **Recent Workbooks** section on the right, if listed. However, if you cannot find the file in the **Recent Workbooks** section, click on “**Browse**” and choose the **corrupted workbook**.

![Click on Open and browse the corrupted workbook](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-3.png)

- Click the drop-down arrow on the **Open** tab and select **Open and Repair**.

![after selecting the corrupt excel, click on the drop-down next to Open and click on Open and Repair](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-4.png)

### Method 2: Check if exporting a Heavy File is Causing Resource Limitations in Excel

Sometimes, when you try to export an Excel sheet carrying a huge database, you may face memory errors in older Excel versions like Excel 2003. Here, you’ll have to decrease the amount of data as Excel 2003 does not permit exporting extensive data beyond a limit. However, modern versions such as Excel 2007, 2010 & 2016 allow exporting a large amount of data and utilize more RAM than the older versions.

Following are some other workarounds:

- Use a lesser number of query presentation fields to re-generate the query. Then, again re-enter those fields.
- Decrease the multi-line string field data text up to 8000 characters.

### Method 3: Copy Macros and Data to Another Workbook (Empty) in an Advanced Excel version

If the issue is occurring due to version incompatibility, i.e., if the file opens easily in the older version but shows errors in the new version. You can:

**Use the older version to open the file or copy the data or macros in an empty workbook of the new version of Excel.**  

#### Copying the Macros in the Workstation

In Microsoft Excel, you can use the **Visual Basic Editor** to open the workbook with macro on another workbook by copying the macro. Both VBA tools and Macros appear in the Developer section of the excel file. This option is disabled by default. So first, you need to enable it.

Follow the instructions to enable it:

- Open Excel and go to **File** > **Options.**

![In the file menu, go to Options](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-5.png)

## How to Fix Excel Formulas Not Working Properly | Step-by-Step Guide

**Summary:** Excel formulas sometimes fail to function correctly and even return an error. This article explains what you might be doing wrong that prevents Excel formulas from working properly and solutions to resolve the issue. If your formulas have disappeared from the Excel spreadsheet and you are having trouble recovering them, you can use an Excel repair tool to recover the formulas.

[![Free Download for Windows](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/free-download-windows.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/ "Free Download for Windows")

When working with Excel formulas, situations may arise when the formula doesn’t calculate or update automatically. Or, you may receive errors by clicking on a formula.

## Problems Causing the ‘Excel Formulas not Working Properly’ Issue and Solutions

Let’s check out the possible reasons that cause Excel formulas to work properly and solutions to resolve the issue.

### Problem 1 – Switching Automatic to Manual Calculation Mode

Automatic and manual are the two modes of calculation in Microsoft Excel.

By default, Excel is set to automatic calculation mode. Everything is recalculated automatically when any changes are made in a worksheet in this mode. You may switch from automatic to manual mode to disable the recalculation of formulas, particularly when working with a large Excel file with too many formulas.

Excel will not calculate automatically when set to manual calculation mode. And this may make you think that the Excel formula is not working properly.

### Solution – Change Calculation Mode from Manual to Automatic

To do so, perform these steps:

- Click on the column with problematic formulas.
- Go to the **Formulas** tab, click the **Calculation Options** drop-down, and select **Automatic**.

![Automatic to Manual Calculation Mode](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/switch-manual-to-automatic-calculation-1.png)

### Problem 2 – Missing or Mismatched Parentheses

It’s easy to miss or incorrectly place parentheses or include extra parentheses in a complex formula. If a parenthesis is missing or mismatched and you click Enter after entering a formula, Excel displays a message window suggesting to fix the issue (refer to the screenshot below).

![Missing or Mismatched Parentheses](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/missing-or-mismatched-parantheses-2.png)

Clicking ‘Yes’ might help fix the issue. But Excel might not fix the parentheses properly, as it tends to add the missing parentheses at the end of a formula which won’t always be the case.

### Solution – Check for Visual Cues When Typing or Editing a Formula with Parentheses

When typing a formula or editing one, Excel provides visual cues to determine if there’s an issue with the parentheses inserted in a formula. Checking for these visual cues can help you fix missing/mismatched parentheses.

- Excel helps identify parenthesis pairs by highlighting them in different colors. For instance, the pair of parenthesis outside is black.
- Excel does not make the opening parentheses bold. So, if you’ve inserted the last closing parentheses in a formula, you can determine if your parentheses are mismatched.
- Excel helps identify parentheses pairs by highlighting and formatting them with the same color once you cross over them.

### Problem 3 – Formatting Cells in an Excel Formula

When adding a number in an Excel formula, don’t add any decimal separator or special characters like $ or €. You may use a comma to separate a function’s argument in an Excel formula or use a currency sign like $ or € as part of cell references. Formatting the numbers may prevent the formula from functioning correctly.

### Solution – Use Format Cells Option for Formatting

Use Format Cells instead of using a comma or currency signs for formatting a number in the formula. For instance, rather than entering a value of $10,000 in your formula, insert 10000, and click the ‘Ctrl+1’ keys together to open the Format Cells dialog box.

![Format Cells Option](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/format-cells-3-1.png)

### Problem 4 – Formatting Numbers as Text

Numbers are displayed as left-aligned in a sheet in a worksheet, and text formatted numbers are right-aligned in cells. Excel considers numbers formatted as text to be text strings. Thus, it leaves those numbers out of calculations. As a result, a formula won’t work as intended. For example, in the following screenshot, you can see that the SUM formula works correctly for normal numbers. But, when the SUM formula is applied to numbers formatted as text, the formula doesn’t return the correct value.

![Cells Formatted as Text](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/cells-formatted-as-text-4.png)

Sometimes, you may also see an apostrophe in the cells or green triangles in the top-left corner of all the cells when numbers in those cells are formatted as Text.

### Solution – Do Not Format Numbers as Text

To fix the issue, do the following:

- Select the cells with numbers stored as text, right-click on them, and click Format Cells.
- From the Format Cells window, click on Number and then press OK.

![Format Cells in Excel](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/format-cells-5.png)

### Problem 5 – Double Quotes to Enclose Numbers

Avoid enclosing numbers in a formula in double-quotes, as the numbers are interpreted as a string value.

Meaning if you enter a formula like =IF(A1>B1, “1”), Excel will consider the output one as a string and not a number. So, you won’t be able to use 1’s in calculations.

### Solution – Don’t Enclose Numbers in Double Quotes

Remove any double quotes around a number in your formula unless you want that number to be treated as text. For example, you can write the formula mentioned above as “1” =IF(A1>B1, 1).

### Problem 6 – Extra Space at Beginning of the Formula

When entering a formula, you may end up adding an extra space before the equal (=) sign. You may also add an apostrophe (‘) in the formula at times. As a result, the calculation won’t be performed and may return an error. This usually happens when you use a formula copied from the web.

### Solution – Remove Extra Space from the Formula

The fix to this issue is pretty simple. You need to look for extra space before the equal sign and remove it. Also, ensure there is an additional apostrophe added in the formula.

## Other Things to Consider to Fix the ‘Excel Formulas not Working Properly’ Issue

- If your Excel formula is not showing the result as intended, see this [blog](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/).
- When you refer to other worksheets with spaces or any non-alphabetical character in their names, enclose the names in ‘single quotation marks’. For example, an external 5reference to cell A2 in a sheet named Data enclose the name in single quotes: **‘Data’!A1**.
- You may see the formula instead of the result if you have accidentally clicked the ‘Show Formulas’ option. So, click on the problematic cell, click on the Formula tab, and then click Show Formulas.
- If you’re getting an error “Excel found a problem with one or more formula references in this worksheet”, find solutions to fix the error [here](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/).

## Conclusion

## Case 3: Wrong Text Value

The #Value! error can also occur due to the formula’s wrong value.

For example: If you are using the formula to add values in cells and Excel recognizes the unexpected text value, you may get a #Value error.

![Image of #Value! error in Excel because of Wrong Text Value](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/error-with-wrong-text-value.png)

**Solution**

To fix the issue, you can correct the value or use the SUM function. It is recommended to use functions instead of operations to reduce the errors. In Excel, the formulas with math operators may not able to calculate the text in the cells. The SUM function automatically ignores the text value(er), calculates everything as numbers, and displays the result without the #Value! error.

## Case 4: Blank Space in Cells

You may get the #Value! error if your formula refers to other cells with space or hidden space. Sometimes, spaces that make a cell display blank but actually they are not blank.

## Case 4: Problem with Network Connection

Many users have reported experiencing errors when using Excel online due to problems with the network connection.

**Solution**

Check your Internet connection and see if it is working properly.  

## Case 5: Wrong Formula Format

If you enter the wrong formula with a missing parenthesis or comma, then Excel can throw the #Value! error. The error can also occur if the application finds a special character within a cell.

**Solution**

Correct the formula and use the ISTEXT function to find the cells with issues.
