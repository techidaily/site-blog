## How can I fix iPhone Storage Not Loading/Showing?

### 1\. Wait a bit more

Some computing operations take a while to finish. Your phone’s storage may overflow with tons of app data, images, and other files if you’ve been using it for a while.

And each of them would have to load before reporting their combined size to the OS. Usually, loading takes about three minutes.

### 2\. Update iOS

If your iOS version was outdated, your phone’s functionalities, including storage access, would not function properly. Additionally, updating the OS will get rid of any potential issues. Follow the procedures listed below to check and update your iOS version:

- Select **General** from the **Settings** menu.
- Click on **Software Update**. If any updates are available, **download** and **install** them.

### 3\. Force Stops the App

The settings app itself can be the problem due to an app bug. Therefore, forcing the app to close is a valid option. This will make the software restart from scratch, wiping off part of the data and information it had in RAM.

- Access the **app switcher** (swipe up your finger from the bottom of the screen to bring up the menu or double-click the **Home** button on older iPhone models).

![App switcher](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/App-switcher.png)

- Relaunch the **Settings app** to see if the problem persists.

### 4\. Reconnect to iCloud

iOS has been designed in a way that it needs to be connected to iCloud to function flawlessly. Therefore, the storage loading error could also be linked to connectivity issues between these two. In this case, signing out of the service and then back in again might resolve the issue.

- Open the **Settings** application.
- Click your profile at the top. To sign out of the service, tap **iCloud**.

For any software-related issues with your phone, this is a great fix, and it may even repair your iPhone storage not updating problem.

- Connect your phone to computers that have **iTunes** installed on them with a lightning cord.
- The storage data should be able to sync with your smartphone automatically.
- If not, press the **Sync** button.

### 6\. Factory Reset Your iPhone
