## Guide to Completely Erase Data on iPhone to Avoid Privacy Leak

With growing instances of data leak and misuse, there's a fear of digital data on iPhone landing in wrong hands. Personal photos, messages, videos, contacts, or sensitive information such as bank details, shopping apps ID etc., are at risk when selling, trading off, recycling or donating your iOS device.

So what can you do to keep your old iPhone data away from strangers' eyes and make it 100% unrecoverable?

One solution is the commonly used Apple's recommendation — erase iPhone data by choosing 'erase all content and settings' on your device. However, with professional hackers and sophisticated software available, erasing data by this method doesn't guarantee data privacy.

Experts suggest using trusted iPhone erasure software that is 100 % safe. The software can make iPhone data unrecoverable beyond the reach of any tool.

Let's understand in detail how to permanently erase data on iPhone by these techniques.
