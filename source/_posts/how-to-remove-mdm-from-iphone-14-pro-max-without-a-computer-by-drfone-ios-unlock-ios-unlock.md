## What Is Remote Management on iPhone 14 Pro Max

Providing employees with company-issued iPhones or other organizational devices has become a common practice in the corporate landscape. These devices serve as multifunctional tools, facilitating seamless communication, productivity, and access to critical business applications.

If you noticed the "Remote Management" screen on your iPhone 14 Pro Max, that's the manifestation of MDM at work. As we have mentioned, MDM is a security feature to oversee and control devices used by their employees. This ensures that company policies are enforced and sensitive information is protected.

MDM allows administrators to configure settings, install applications, and enforce security protocols on connected devices. They can stop you from using certain things, such as the App Store and AirDrop. MDM also handles VPN settings and lists of blocked websites.

## How to Remove Remote Management on iPhone 14 Pro Max via Settings

The primary reason people want to remove remote management on iPhone is that they've acquired it from their workplace or as a second-hand purchase. If the remote management profile isn't removed, you won’t be able to use the iPhone fully. Sometimes, even a factory reset won't unlock the iPhone if the remote management is still in place.

Thankfully, if the devices are still logged in with the MDM profile credentials, you can still resolve this through the Settings menu.

How to remove Remote Management on iPhone via Settings:

- **Step 1**: Locate iPhone Settings.

Open the `"Settings"` app on your iPhone 14 Pro Max. Scroll until you find `"General"` from the menu and tap.

- **Step 2**: Open your profile on VPN & Device Management.

In the General Settings, open the `"VPN & Device Management"` option and tap on the profile associated with the MDM.

- **Step 3**: Check for the `"Remove"` button.

Look for a button that says `"Remove"` within the profile. If you see this button, you can proceed to remove remote management from iPhone on your own. Follow any on-screen prompts or confirmations to complete the removal process.

![Remove](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/remove-mdm-from-iphone/1.avif)

- **Step 4**: Contact MDM Admin if Needed:

If you do not see the `"Remove" button`, it means that you need to contact the MDM administrator for further assistance. Reach out to them to initiate the removal process.

## Difference Between Activation Lock and Locked Apple ID

Apple being Apple, does a lot to make sure that users get the smoothest experience possible when interacting with their Apple products, both hardware, and software. Yet, sometimes, the messaging gets confusing, and people are not sure what is what. One such thing is the difference between iCloud Activation Lock and Apple ID Lock. While people are more likely to encounter Activation Lock and less likely to encounter Apple ID Lock, they are often confused when they encounter Apple ID Lock and struggle to figure out what that means and how to resolve the issue.

Activation Lock is when your supported Apple device is locked for a number of reasons. The most common reason is a stolen device that was locked by its owner, however, there are other perfectly valid reasons such as an outgoing employee forgetting to sign out and erase their Apple device before submitting it back. The IT department would not be able to reset that device without turning off Find My Phone and Activation Lock on the device.

A locked Apple ID usually happens when the user has forgotten their password to their Apple ID account and attempts to figure out the password have been unsuccessful. Sometimes, Apple ID gets locked automatically under some conditions, and that requires users to reset their password to gain access. A locked Apple ID does not mean that your device is locked for your use. You can keep using it so long as you do not try to use another Apple ID with it since to do that you would have to sign out of your current Apple ID (which is locked) and you won't be able to do that. On the other hand, Activation Lock renders the entire device unusable till the lock is cleared.

![Locked Apple ID](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/unlock-iphone-without-apple-id/1.webp)

In short, Apple ID Lock is about a user's account with Apple, akin to how Google Account works on Android devices. Apple ID Lock locks a user's account with Apple while retaining complete usage of the device whereas Activation Lock locks the device and prevents anyone from using it until the correct credentials are entered. This is about verifying the ownership of the device and works to deter theft of Apple devices.

## Activation Lock Primer

Apple products are costly, and they are prized. When a 5-year-old Android device might be left alone without anyone stealing it, you cannot risk that with an iPhone 6S, even today. Apple has built an Activation Lock in its devices to deter theft and so far, as we know, it has largely succeeded. If your iPhone 14 Pro Max 13 gets stolen, no one else can use it with their Apple ID unless they key in the credentials it was using previously (your credentials) and, even then, Apple has bolstered iCloud Find My Activation Lock to be more restrictive. You may have to key in a lot of information ranging from your device password (if you are also using the same Apple ID on a Mac) to your iOS device passcode too, obviously, your Apple ID password. It is a system that works in favor of Apple users.

Yet, in some cases, users want to get around the Activation Lock for genuine reasons, say, when you buy a used Apple device from someone. They may have forgotten to remove that device from their Apple account and Activation Lock would not let you use it. Or, you are an IT administrator, and you manage devices given out to employees. Some employees did not remove their accounts from their devices, and now those iPhones are riddled with Activation Lock. You can remove it using this step-by-step guide.

## What Can You Do with Face ID?

Most of us know that we can unlock iPhone 14 Pro Max with our face via Face ID instead of a thumbprint or passcode. But actually, Face ID does more than just that. Let us learn more cool things you can do with Face ID, which helps you to make a decision if you still want to disable it. Here‘s what you can do on your iPhone 14 Pro Max with Face ID:

### Unlock Your iPhone 14 Pro Max

As an authentication mechanism, Face ID enables you to unlock your iPhone 14 Pro Max with a look. How to do that? Here are the steps:

- **Step1**: Pick your iPhone 14 Pro Max up in your hands or tap the screen to wake it up.
- **Step2**: Look at the iPhone.
  When the lock symbol changes to the unlocked position, you can swipe up to unlock your iPhone 14 Pro Max using Face ID and get to the Home Screen.Note that Face ID will not work in landscape mode on an iPhone 14 Pro Max.

### Making Purchases Using Face ID on Your iPhone 14 Pro Max

Face ID allows you to authenticate yourself to make purchases in the App Store, Book Store, and iTunes Store and use Apple Pay wherever supported.

### Lowering Ringer and Alarm Volume Automatically

Face ID also enables what Apple calls Attention Aware features that are conveniences afforded to users who have a Face ID enabled iPhone.

![What is Face ID?](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/how-to-remove-face-id-on-iphone/5.avif)

Setting up and using Attention Aware features is easy:

- **Step 1**: Go to `Settings` > `Face ID` and passcode.

- **Step 2**: Toggle Require Attention For Face ID On.

- **Step 3**: Toggle Attention Aware Features On.

That's it. Now, when you get a call and your iPhone 14 Pro Max is ringing loud, looking at your iPhone 14 Pro Max will cause it to lower the volume. When an alarm goes off, you can lower the volume by simply looking at your iPhone. Additionally, your iPhone screen will not dim or switch off for the duration you are looking at it. This means you can now read those books on Kindle without constantly tapping the screen for it to stay awake.

### Autofill Passwords and Usernames in Safari and Other Apps

Face ID also allows users to fill passwords in Safari automatically for a faster and more convenient login experience on your iPhone 15/14/13 with Face ID.

Step 1: Go to Settings > Face ID and Passcode and toggle Password Autofill On.

Step 2: Now, when you use Safari to open a website that requires a login, tapping the username field or password field will bring up the keyboard, and on top of that keyboard there will be your credentials for the website if you have saved them in iCloud Passwords. Tap the credentials.

Step 3: Look at your iPhone to authenticate yourself with Face ID and Safari will autofill the credentials for you.

### Authenticate Yourself for Third-Party Apps

Face ID is also used for authenticating you for third-party apps that support Face ID. This means you can use Face ID to authenticate yourself for banking apps, password managers, and other apps that support Face ID.

### Animojis and Memojis

Up until now, we saw how Face ID enables productivity features and how convenient it is to use it. Now, we come to the fun part - Animojis. Apple launched Face ID in 2017 on the iPhone X with much fanfare and a huge part of that fanfare was Animojis. Over time, Apple brought new capabilities to the iPhone and added Memojis alongside Animojis.

![Animojis and Memojis](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/how-to-remove-face-id-on-iphone/6.avif)

Animojis are animated emojis. These are made possible with advanced algorithms enabled by the TrueDepth camera in Face ID. Animated emojis or Animojis can mimic your facial expressions and you can use them in your message conversations in apps.

Here‘s how to send Animojis in conversations on your new iPhone 14 Pro Max:

Step 1: Open a message conversation in the Messages app.

Step 2: Tap the Memoji button (a character in a yellow frame) and swipe to select the desired Animoji/ Memoji you want to send.

![Animojis and Memojis](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/how-to-remove-face-id-on-iphone/7.avif)

Step 3: Tap the Record button and you now have 30 seconds to do what you want with your face and the character will reproduce it on screen for you.

Step 4: When done, the Record button changes to Send:

![Animojis and Memojis](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/how-to-remove-face-id-on-iphone/8.avif)
