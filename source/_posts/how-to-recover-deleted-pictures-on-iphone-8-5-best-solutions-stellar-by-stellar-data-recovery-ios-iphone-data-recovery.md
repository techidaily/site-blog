## How to Recover deleted pictures on iPhone? 5 Best Solutions

For many iPhone users, photos are the most important data stored on their device – so losing those photos can be a disaster.

However, even if you accidentally deleted some or all of your pictures on iPhone, you can get them back.

We'll discuss how to recover deleted photos on your iPhone with or without backup.

## **How to Recover Deleted Pictures on iPhone?**

There are five best solutions to recover deleted pictures on iPhone. Use the solution that fits your needs and helps you recover your lost pictures.

### 1\. Recover Deleted Pictures on iPhone from Recently Deleted Albums

Pictures taken with the iPhone Camera application are saved by default in the Photos application. If a photo or video is deleted, it's moved to the Recently Deleted folder in the Photos app. This folder is the same as your computer’s Recycle Bin and retains the deleted photos for 30 days. Once this period expires, your photos are permanently deleted from this folder. Perform these steps if you want to recover recently deleted photos on your iPhone:

- Open the **Photos** app.
- Tap on **Albums** at the bottom.

- Scroll down to find the **Recently** **Deleted** folder.

**Note** – If you want to restore all the deleted photos from your **Recently Deleted** folder, tap on the **Recover All** button.

## **How to Recover Deleted Pictures on iPhone From a Backup?**

If your photos are not in the **Recently Deleted** folder, you might get them back by restoring your iPhone from a previous backup. There are three ways to restore deleted photos on iPhone – iCloud website, iTunes backup, or Finder.

When recovering photos from your iPhone from backup, pay attention to the date of creation of your backups. Use the most recent backup but don't delete all older backups. It's always good to have multiple backups if something goes wrong.

### 2\. Recover Photos on iPhone using iCloud via the iCloud website

In this blog, we will talk about different ways to delete photos from iPhones beyond the scope of recovery.

## **How to Delete All Photos from iPhone?**

Before deleting all photos from the iPhone, it’s important to take a backup of all photos to avoid any accidental data loss situation. There are various ways to back up your iPhone photos:

### **1\. iCloud**

Use iCloud to back up all your photos automatically. To sync iCloud with Photos –

- Go to **Settings** > \[**your** **name**\] > **iCloud** > **Photos**, and turn on **iCloud** **Photos**.

![sync iCloud with Photos](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-8b4e845/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/sync-icloud-with-photos.jpg)

Your photos will be backed up to iCloud automatically if your device has enough storage space and is connected to Wi-Fi.

### **2\. iTunes:**

You can even use iTunes to back up your iPhone photos. To do this,

- Connect your **iPhone** to your system.
- Launch **iTunes** and then select your **device**.
- Click **Summary** > “**Back Up Now**” to create a backup of all your data, including photos.

![sync Photos with iTunes](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-8b4e845/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/sync-photos-with-iTunes.jpg)
