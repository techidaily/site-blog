If your iPhone is dead and not working at all, and you want to learn how to recover data from dead iPhone, this blog is exclusively for you.

## **Why would an iPhone suddenly go dead?**

These are the possible reasons why iPhone turns dead or blank for hours:

1. A defective charging cable or adapter that doesn’t perfectly pair with your iOS device.
2. A recent iOS update that triggered some unforeseen software error in your iPhone.
3. Faulty or failed hardware, like a battery or a logic board that needs to be replaced.

In either of the above-mentioned conditions, your iPhone will stop responding to any command. Turning the device off and restarting works in rare circumstances, but not always. In such bleak situations, you can try to fix your dead iPhone using these tips:

- Keep a close watch over the charging cable or power adapter and fix the loose ends.
- Put your dead iPhone on charge for at least an hour.
- Connect your iPhone to iTunes or put it on Device Firmware Update (DFU) mode.

If these attempts won’t bring your iPhone back to life, certainly it has some major technical glitch that only Apple experts can address. Before submitting your device for the same, recover all the data stored in it. Follow these DIY solutions to **recover data from dead iPhone**:

### **Use iTunes to Recover Data from Dead iPhone**

- Next, select **Consolidate files** to organize the Library screen and press **OK**.
