This is why we need to know how to recover data from broken iPhone screens.

These days, though there are plenty of best ways to back up your data, users often overlook the importance of Backup. It happened with _Jacky Jainco; w_hile taking a DSLR-like photo on his iPhone 14 Pro Max, he accidentally dropped his iPhone and, consequently, broke it.

The real problem was not the broken iPhone but to recover data from iPhone as it was not synced with iTunes and iCloud Backup. As a result, he couldn’t access his files, more importantly, his pictures.

You might have dropped your iPhone several times, and luckily, the excellent cover has saved it on all occasions. However, any drop could cause potential damage putting your data at stake; therefore, leverage iTunes or iCloud backup to recover data from the [damaged iPhone](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/how-to-fix-retrieve-pictures-videos-from-water-damaged-iphone/) screen.

## Why Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone takes time in scanning my iPhone?

**Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone thoroughly scans your iOS device, computer, and iCloud to retrieve every bit of data. However, the scanning time of the software** depends upon the following:

- **The amount of data in your iOS device:** Greater the amount of data on your iPhone more time it will take to scan.
- **The size of RAM on your iPhone:** Greater the RAM more will be the scanning time. For instance, the software will take more time to thoroughly scan an iPhone 12 with 6GB RAM compared to iPhone 11 that has 4GB RAM.
- **RAM of your computer:** The recommended system requirement of Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone is 8GB. Although it can scan and recover from 4GB RAM computer, but you may experience slow speed.
