In this article, we’ll talk about the essential factors involved in data migration of two devices with different operating systems. We will also provide a few tutorials on how to **transfer data from Vivo Y100i to iPhone 15** conveniently. Continue reading below to learn more.


## Factors to Consider When Transferring Data From Vivo Y100i to iPhone

It’s probably true to say that data migration is a major procedure. It’s not just a simple file-sharing method that can be completed in no time. A lot of things are involved when data is transferred from one device to another. To help you understand it better, below is a list of factors affecting the quality and speed of data migration.

### File Size

The size of files being transferred affects the process in general. This is because the Vivo Y100i device on the receiving end needs to allocate the data individually to the available space. That’s why the procedure often takes some time to complete if the volume of files is quite large. On the hand one hand, data migration gets completed in a snap if the file size is smaller.

### File Type

The type of files involved in the data transfer is also a factor. Why so? The simplest explanation is that compatibility matters a lot in any form of file transfer. For instance, the procedure will likely fail if the receiver’s device does not support the data you’re trying to send. But don’t worry. There are lots of methods to transfer data from Vivo Y100i to iPhone 15 if your first try doesn’t work out.

### Device Storage

Device storage is definitely the first thing you should check before going ahead with the data transfer. It is important that the receiver’s device has adequate memory to accommodate the incoming files. Otherwise, the transfer will likely not push through.

### Operating Systems

Migrating files between two smartphones with the same operating system is convenient. It’s because these two devices share an identical data-sharing structure. On the one hand, data migration between two smartphones with different operating systems is almost similar to the former. It’s just that the steps for the latter are quite longer. But don’t sweat it. There are many tutorials that can help you transfer data from Vivo Y100i to iPhone 15 conveniently.

## Part 2: Transfer Data Using PhoneCopy

In order to do so, you need:

**A registered PhoneCopy account.**

1\. On your computer, open any web browser of your choice and go to <https://www.phonecopy.com/en/>.

Note: Make sure your device is connected to the Internet.

2\. From the right section of the opened web page, click "REGISTER NOW."

3\. On the "REGISTRATION" page, populate the available fields with the correct values and click "CONTINUE" from the bottom.

4\. Follow the on-screen instructions thereafter to complete the account creation process.

Note: You may need to activate your account using the confirmation mail that you would receive while completing the account creation process.

**The PhoneCopy app on your Windows phone.**

1\. Power on your Vivo Y100i smartphone.

Note: Make sure that the phone is connected to the Internet.

2\. From the Home screen, locate and tap the Store icon to open the Windows App Store.

Note: You must use your Microsoft account to sign in to Windows Store before the phone allows you to download the apps.

3\. Once you are on the "store" interface, search for and tap the "PhoneCopy" app

4\. On the next window that appears, tap "Install" pato install PhoneCopy on your Windows phone.

After you have successfully installed PhoneCopy on your Vivo Y100i, it is now time to export all your contacts to the PhoneCopy server. You can do so by following the steps given below:

**Step 1: Export data to the PhoneCopy server.**

1\. On your Windows phone, locate and tap to launch the "PhoneCopy" app.

2\. On the displayed interface, in the available fields provide your PhoneCopy account credentials (username and password) that you used to create your PhoneCopy account earlier.

3\. Once done, tap the"Export to phonecopy.com" button and wait till all your contacts are exported to the PhoneCopy server.

**Step 2: Import data to the iPhone from the PhoneCopy server.**

1\. Power on your iPhone.

Note: Make sure that your phone is connected to the Internet.

2\. From the Home screen, locate and tap the Apple App Store icon.

Note: Ensure that you are signed in to the App Store using your Apple ID.

3\. Search for, locate, download, and install the "PhoneCopy" app on your iPhone

4\. Once installed, tap the "PhoneCopy" icon on your iOS device to launch the program.

5\. When asked for, provide the same PhoneCopy credentials that you used to export the data from your Vivo Y100i phone in the previous step.

6\. After you are signed in to your PhoneCopy account on your iPhone, click the "Synchronize" button to import all the data from the PhoneCopy server to your new iPhone.

Although PhoneCopy does a great job when it comes to transferring data between the phones from different platforms, the app comes with a few pros and cons which include:

Pros:

Registering and using PhoneCopy is free.

PhoneCopy can back up your calendar events, SMS, tasks, and notes and can help you import them on a different phone (typically on iPhone).

Cons:

Only up to 500 contacts, SMS, tasks, and notes can be synched while using the Basic version (free account) of PhoneCopy. To remove this restriction, you must buy the Premium version for which PhoneCopy charges $25 annually.

The archived data is auto-deleted from the PhoneCopy server after one month when using the Basic version, and after 1 year when using the Premium version.
