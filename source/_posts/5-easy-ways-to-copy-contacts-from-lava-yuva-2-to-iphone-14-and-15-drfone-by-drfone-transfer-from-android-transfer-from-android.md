Even with the reliable methods mentioned earlier, there may be instances where you encounter difficulties in transferring texts from your Android to your iPhone. Don't worry; we've got you covered with solutions to common issues that might hinder a smooth transfer.

- **1\. Interrupted transfer**

The transfer process may be interrupted if you use other apps, receive a phone call, or navigate away from the transfer screen on your Lava Yuva 2 before it completes. So, make sure that both devices are left undisturbed until the transfer process is complete.

If you navigate away from the "Move to iOS" app on your Android or receive a phone call during the transfer, it may disrupt the process. Restart the transfer and keep both devices active until completion.

- **2\. Problems with Wi-Fi connection**

Wi-Fi connection issues on the Android device can hinder the transfer process. This may be caused by apps or settings affecting Wi-Fi, such as Sprint Connections Optimizer or the Smart Network Switch.

To address it, you can turn off apps or settings that might affect Wi-Fi on your Lava Yuva 2, forget known Wi-Fi networks, and retry the transfer. It’s important to maintain a stable Wi-Fi connection on both devices throughout the transfer.

Users may encounter situations where only some content is transferred, or the iOS device appears full despite an incomplete transfer. This can lead to potential data loss.

For this issue, you can consider erasing your iOS device and starting the transfer again. Make sure that the available space on your iPhone accommodates the Android content. Delete unnecessary data or apps on your iPhone to free up space if needed.

## Bonus: How to Back Up Messages with Google Drive

In addition to seamless transfers between devices, backing up your text messages becomes equally important. Fortunately, Google Drive offers a convenient solution by allowing you to back up your messages with ease.

## Part 6: Clone Lava Yuva 2 Phone Using Bluetooth

Using Bluetooth for cloning an Android phone is not the most efficient method. It is more suitable for transferring specific files than creating a comprehensive clone. Moreover, it's a slow and manual process that requires you to select and transfer files one by one. Here's how you can use Bluetooth for this purpose:

1\. On both Android devices, turn on Bluetooth and pair the Lava Yuva 2 devices. Navigate to the file you want to send on the source device, tap "Share," and select "Bluetooth."

2\. Now, choose the targeted device to send the file. Move to the other device and "Accept" the incoming file transfer.

## FAQs

### 1\. Is Android phone clone safe?

Cloning an Android phone using reputable and trusted methods, apps, or tools is generally safe. Nonetheless, it is of utmost importance to exercise prudence and employ trustworthy software to safeguard your personal data. Be sure to obtain apps and tools exclusively from reputable sources, such as the Google Play Store, and adhere to the best data security practices.

### 2\. Can I clone between different Android phone models or brands?

The ability to clone between different Android phone models or brands depends on the specific method or tool you are using. Dedicated phone transfer apps like Wondershare Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer or Phone Clone are often designed to work across various Android models and brands.

### 3\. What should I do before cloning my Android phone to ensure a smooth process?

Before commencing the cloning procedure for your Lava Yuva 2, creating a backup of your device's data is crucial. It can be accomplished by using either the integrated backup feature or a trustworthy third-party app.

This precautionary step guarantees the safety of your data should any issues arise during the cloning procedure. Moreover, it's imperative to verify that both devices are running the most up-to-date software updates and application versions.
