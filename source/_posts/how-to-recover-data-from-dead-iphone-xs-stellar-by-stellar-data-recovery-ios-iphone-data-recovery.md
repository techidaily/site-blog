This blog encapsulates all such concrete details with a step-by-step guide to recover data from dead iPhone.

iPhone is one of the most affluent smartphones loaded with advanced features. Most people invest in it because its upbeat features and advanced technology intrigue them. Every time Apple announces a new upgrade or introduces new features to its iOS software upgrade, iPhone fans dig deep to learn more about it.

If your iPhone is dead and not working at all, and you want to learn how to recover data from dead iPhone, this blog is exclusively for you.

## **Why would an iPhone suddenly go dead?**

These are the possible reasons why iPhone turns dead or blank for hours:

1. A defective charging cable or adapter that doesn’t perfectly pair with your iOS device.
2. A recent iOS update that triggered some unforeseen software error in your iPhone.
3. Faulty or failed hardware, like a battery or a logic board that needs to be replaced.

In either of the above-mentioned conditions, your iPhone will stop responding to any command. Turning the device off and restarting works in rare circumstances, but not always. In such bleak situations, you can try to fix your dead iPhone using these tips:

- Keep a close watch over the charging cable or power adapter and fix the loose ends.
- Put your dead iPhone on charge for at least an hour.
- Connect your iPhone to iTunes or put it on Device Firmware Update (DFU) mode.
- Seek immediate assistance from Apple Support Services.

If these attempts won’t bring your iPhone back to life, certainly it has some major technical glitch that only Apple experts can address. Before submitting your device for the same, recover all the data stored in it. Follow these DIY solutions to **recover data from dead iPhone**:

### **Use iTunes to Recover Data from Dead iPhone**

iTunes is one of the most coveted options to **recover data recovery from dead iPhone**. However, to use this method, your iPhone should be in sync with iTunes, and you have to periodically take data backup on it. Observe the steps to keep data backup on iTunes:

- Connect your iPhone to your computer and open iTunes to login.
- From the menu bar at the top of the iTunes window, select **File > Library > Organize** **Library**.
- Next, select **Consolidate files** to organize the Library screen and press **OK**.
- Once you do that, copies of any files that were not in the iTunes Media folder will be added to your iTunes Media folder.
- At the same time, take the opportunity to eliminate all the duplicate files taking unnecessary space on your hard drive. However, before making this move, save a copy of the original files in your iTunes Media Folder.

If you have been practicing the above steps for long, then simply connect your device with your computer using a USB cable and follow steps to recover data from iTunes backup:

- Connect your iPhone to your computer and open **iTunes**.
- Select your iPhone in the main iTunes window or select it from **Finder**.
- The move will prompt a new set of instructions on iTunes with options to backup data. You need to click on **Restore Backup** to retrieve your dead iPhone’s data.
- Several backup options will prompt on your computer. You can choose a selected set of files to restore a specific file or all of them.
- Once selected, the desired number of files/data to restore, press **Restore**, and wait. The move may restart your iPhone. If not, your device will suffer a more serious hardware failure that only technical experts can fix.

**Pro Tip:** _If found dead, let your iPhone remain off for as long as possible to avoid data overwriting._

### **Use iCloud to Recover Data from Dead iPhone**

If you are proactively using iCloud to maintain data backup, there is a fair chance to recover your dead phone’s data from it. You can directly recover data from iCloud on another iPhone that doesn’t necessarily require connection to a laptop or computer. All you need is an iPhone that can be turned on at least and let you through the initial steps to login to your iCloud. Don’t forget to erase your dead iPhone before continuing on the new one; otherwise, you won’t get to perform the initial set-up. Follow the steps below to restore dead iPhone’s data from iCloud Backup:

- Turn on the working iPhone and perform the initial setup procedures till you get through **Apps & Data**. Tap on **Restore from iCloud Backup** option and sign in with your Apple ID.

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Apps-Data.jpg)

- A window will prompt you with all backups available for restoring. Select the most recent one that contains all the data you wish to retrieve from your dead iPhone.
- Patiently wait for the data transfer procedure to finish.
- In the data transfer procedure, at some point, you might be asked to enter your Apple ID once again. Enter details to keep the action going.
- Once done, you’ll get a notification of successful data transfer.

You can also transfer all your dead iPhone data to a new one by inserting its SIM card in the new iPhone. Learn here how to [Transfer Data from Old iPhone to New iPhone](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/transfer-data-from-old-to-new-iphone/).

## How to Restore Contacts on iPhone (4 Methods)

**Summary:** Many of the users have been wondering about the ways to restore deleted contacts. In this post, we shared the best methods to restore deleted contacts from your iPhone series 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, XS, XS Max, XR, X, 8, 7, 6, and 5.

 [![Free Download for Windows](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/free-download-windows.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/data-recovery-ios/ "Free Download for Windows")[![Free Download for Mac](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/free-download-Mac.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/data-recovery-ios/ "Free Download for Mac")

Losing contact names and numbers from the device all of a sudden is not new for iPhone users. Sometimes contact names are missing with only the random numbers visible, or the contact list is altogether empty. Mostly, the incidents occur after updating to a newer version of iOS, a bug in the device, accidental deletion, or else formatting of the iPhone.

You can always restore from iCloud or iTunes backup, but sometimes even those attempts might fail to recover deleted contacts. This can be because of wrong user names, passcodes, or device settings.

In such cases, the best way to restore only the missing contacts is to use **iPhone Data Recovery Software** by Stellar**.** Read on to know the four solutions to recover deleted contact on iPhone below.

If you have synced your iPhone to iCloud backup, restore missing contact names and numbers with this method.

- Go to your iPhone **Settings > iCloud > Contacts** (iOS 16 & 15 users follow: Settings > User Name > iCloud)

- Toggle OFF and turn ON **Contacts** again

- It asks what you would like to do with the previously synced iCloud contacts on your iPhone. Select **Delete from My iPhone**.

You will get back lost contacts on the iPhone. Those accounts are also displayed in your group lists if you have different Cloud accounts like Gmail linked to your device. You can check and uncheck the group to view or hide, respectively.

This works only when you have backed up your iPhone to iTunes.

- Connect your iPhone to the PC
-  Launch iTunes
- Select your device from the Device list and pick the most recent backup entry date of your iPhone from the Summary page

- Click **Restore Backup**

You can get back the lost or deleted contacts from your iTunes backup. But the drawback of this method is that with iTunes, you do not have a choice to restore only the lost contacts on your iPhone selectively. This means that complete data from iTunes will be restored on your device, replacing existing iPhone data.

All current media photos, videos, messages, etc., on your iPhone will also be replaced by the iOS backup files. If you want to restore only contacts from iTunes backup, use a safe third-party iPhone data recovery application.

The best way to overcome the iTunes drawback and selectively restore only the missing contacts is to use [iPhone Contact Recovery](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/data-recovery-ios/) Software by Stellar.

This secure & do-it-yourself software recovers lost or accidentally deleted iPhone contacts, call history, etc., regardless of the cause of the loss.Experience the Free Trial version NOW!
