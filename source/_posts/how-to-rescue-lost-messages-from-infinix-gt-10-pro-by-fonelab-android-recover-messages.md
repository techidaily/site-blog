    If your messages appear to be lost: don't panic! Unless the medium on which they are stored has been physically damaged, there is still a good chance that they can be recovered However, the chances of recovery depend on how many times the disk, memory card or messages have been written to since the files disappeared. If you have filled up the memory card of Infinix GT 10 Pro with new messages then your old messages will have been overwritten. If not, then don't write to disc or memory card any more until all the options for recovering the messages files have been exhausted.
