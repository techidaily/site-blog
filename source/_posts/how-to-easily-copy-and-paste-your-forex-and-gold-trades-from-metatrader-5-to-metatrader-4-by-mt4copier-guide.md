## How To Share Your Winning Forex Trades With Friends and Family

If you are a successful forex trader, you may want to share your winning trades with friends and family. This can be a great way to help them learn about forex trading and potentially make some money. There are a few different ways you can share your trades with others, so let’s take a look at some of the most popular options.

<iframe width="898" height="503" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g6GCO8K7R2k" title="How To Share Forex Trades With Friends and Family" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

In this video, Rimantas explains how to share your winning Forex trades with friends and family’s accounts so everyone can enjoy success together.

The [trade copier](https://tools.techidaily.com/mt4copier/), a tool often used in Forex trading, can be advantageous for several reasons when it comes to sharing trades with friends and family. Here are five reasons why it helps people:

1. **Ease of Managing Multiple Accounts**: It allows a trader to manage several accounts simultaneously. This means if someone is proficient in trading, they can easily replicate their trades across friends and family’s accounts, ensuring everyone benefits from the successful strategies.
2. **Real-Time Sharing**: The trades are copied in real-time. This synchronization means that friends and family will enter the market at virtually the same time and price as the main account, maintaining the strategy’s integrity and performance.
3. **Educational Opportunity**: For friends and family who are new to Forex trading, observing and engaging in trades through the copier can serve as a valuable learning experience. It allows them to see strategies in action and understand market movements without the need to make all the decisions themselves initially.
4. **Efficiency and Convenience**: Automating the trade copying process saves time and reduces the chance of error in trying to manually replicate trades across multiple accounts. This efficiency means more time can be spent analyzing the markets and refining strategies.

Overall, the [Local Trade Copier](https://tools.techidaily.com/mt4copier/) can democratize access to trading strategies, allow for shared learning experiences, and potentially increase the profitability for all involved parties through shared knowledge and resources.


## How To Copy Trades From MT4 & MT5 Mobile App

![](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/mt4copier/copy-forex-trades-from-mt4-mobile/1.png)

Are you using your mobile device to trade when you can’t get to your desktop setup? Are you using one MetaTrader account to copy trades across to other accounts using the FX Account Cloning setup? Well, then you’ve probably run into the problem that the MetaTrader mobile app doesn’t allow trade copier software. Let me give you a hack that will enable you to do personal copy trading on Android or iOS and copy trades from one Metatrader to another across multiple devices.


If you’ve come across this little snag and are getting frustrated that you can’t run all of your accounts while you’re on the go, then you’re in the right place. Keep on reading, and you’ll soon be able to copy trades from your mobile app to any number of MetaTrader accounts you want!

### How Trades Travel from Your Metatrader Mobile App

So, let’s dive straight in. We have to look at how the trades travel from your MetaTrader mobile app to other devices once you make them. When you have your mobile app open and click to make a trade, where does that signal go next?

Understanding this is the key to setting up a way to copy trades from the Metatrader account on the mobile app to multiple accounts on other devices. That is very similar to what we’ve been doing with the [Local Trade Copier](https://tools.techidaily.com/mt4copier/)™ software in our other tutorials, but this time, there’s a twist that makes it work from an iPhone or Android mobile device. When you know how it works, you can even copy trades from the Android MT4 account to another phone.

![](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/mt4copier/copy-forex-trades-from-mt4-mobile/2.png)

So, here’s the answer. The trick to doing this is taking advantage of how MetaTrader was designed. One of the functions of MetaTrader is that it allows you to log in to the same account from multiple devices. That is simple enough. That’s how a lot of social media accounts work. There’s no trade copier software involved in the process yet. That’s just how MetaTrader was built.

When you log in to your MetaTrader account on your mobile app and your desktop setup (or your VPS server, tablet, laptop, or whatever), you can make a trade on one device, and it will instantly appear on your other device.

So the trick is hardly a trick at all. You log into the same account on different devices and manage your trades. It’s just like posting a photo on Instagram. The moment you click “post” on one device, the image appears on your feed on all your other devices. It also appears on the feed of your friends and family who are following you. They get to see it instantly too.

But what if you want to manage more than one account from your mobile device? Well, then you need a Mobile-To-Many Copycat™ setup illustrated in the graphic below. I hope this helps you understand what I am trying to explain.

![](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/mt4copier/copy-forex-trades-from-mt4-mobile/3.png)

The first thing you’ll notice is that there are two master accounts, MetaTrader Master Account #1 and MetaTrader Master Account #2. Both master accounts are set up on your computer or VPS server. As you can see, each master account controls three client accounts – the three blue ones for Master Account #1 and three purple ones for Master Account #2. In total, that’s eight MetaTrader accounts all running on the same setup. Now, this can be your desktop PC or a VPS server – a VPS is optional, but I highly recommend it if you want to be running multiple accounts smoothly and efficiently.

Of course, the critical step here is to link all of these accounts together using the [Local Trade Copier](https://tools.techidaily.com/mt4copier/)™ software. You can do this easily and quickly, and it is a tried and tested way to clone trades from one account to many. If you need a more detailed explanation, check out my earlier tutorial on the FX Account Cloning setup.

There’s just one other important thing to remember. The MetaTrader mobile app will let you log in to multiple accounts from one device, just not simultaneously. So, if you want to manage more than one master account from your Metatrader mobile app, you need to switch between accounts by logging out of one account and logging back into the other. That is a bit clunky, but it shouldn’t stop you from achieving what you need.

In the following image, you can see that I have accounts from Darwinex, Fusion Markets, IC Markets, and Tripleafx on one Metatrader mobile app. That is a great way to get an overview of all your accounts, and you can easily switch between them to manage your trades, view your balance, or change settings.

![](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/mt4copier/copy-forex-trades-from-mt4-mobile/4.png)

As long as you’ve completed the link up with the client accounts with the [Local Trade Copier](https://tools.techidaily.com/mt4copier/)™ software on your computer, you can use these accounts on your mobile app to clone trades across as many accounts as you need!

### Copy trades from Android MT4 account to another device

I know to some of you, all of this sounds simple, but remember when you were new to using MetaTrader and running different accounts? I’ve included a few screenshots below to ensure that even new users get how this works. They show what this process looks like on Metatrader.

So here you have a screenshot of my VPS and the MetaTrader mobile app. This way, I can show you what happens when I make a trade.

![](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/mt4copier/copy-forex-trades-from-mt4-mobile/5.png)

In the following screenshot, you’ll see that when I open a trade in the Metatrader mobile app, it immediately appears on the master account and instantly gets sent to the client accounts. Getting trades copied across Metatrader accounts on different devices is like magic, right?

![](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/mt4copier/copy-forex-trades-from-mt4-mobile/6.png)

### Copy trades from Android MT5 account to another computer

Of course, this works on MetaTrader 4 and MetaTrader 5 in the same way. Check out the following screenshot, which illustrates how I sent a trade to both client accounts. Both accounts picked up the trade and copied it perfectly. It means you can trade multiple accounts simultaneously from the MT5 Mobile app.

![](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/mt4copier/copy-forex-trades-from-mt4-mobile/7.png)

[Local Trade Copier](https://tools.techidaily.com/mt4copier/)™ will take care of the money management automatically. The beauty of this is that you can copy trades across with all of your settings and make sure that the lot sizes are appropriate to the size of the client accounts. If the capital of the client account is bigger than the master account, you can be sure that the lot size is appropriate for that account.

The [Local Trade Copier](https://tools.techidaily.com/mt4copier/)™ software allows you to copy any settings you need, whether it’s trade filtering, risk management, stop-loss limits, whatever you want. It all works great!

Here’s a video where I explain how the [Local Trade Copier](https://tools.techidaily.com/mt4copier/) works:

So, you have just learned how to copy your trades to multiple MetaTrader accounts from your mobile device in no time at all. You can be anywhere in the world and run accounts for yourself, your friends and family, or any number of clients. Gone are the days when you’d be kicking yourself because you couldn’t get to your computer on time to take advantage of some fundamental market movements.

They say that knowledge is power and, if that’s true, you just gained a lot of power, folks! With what you’ve just learned, you don’t need to miss out on those important events anymore. Now you can be sitting by the hotel pool on holiday and still make those trades across multiple accounts whenever you need to.

With just one click, you can send your Forex and Gold trades from your MT4 walkie-talkie to your friend’s MT5 walkie-talkie. It’s that simple!
