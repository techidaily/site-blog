## How to Recover deleted pictures on iPhone? 5 Best Solutions

For many iPhone users, photos are the most important data stored on their device – so losing those photos can be a disaster.

However, even if you accidentally deleted some or all of your pictures on iPhone, you can get them back.

We'll discuss how to recover deleted photos on your iPhone with or without backup.

## **How to Recover Deleted Pictures on iPhone?**

There are five best solutions to recover deleted pictures on iPhone. Use the solution that fits your needs and helps you recover your lost pictures.

### 1\. Recover Deleted Pictures on iPhone from Recently Deleted Albums

Pictures taken with the iPhone Camera application are saved by default in the Photos application. If a photo or video is deleted, it's moved to the Recently Deleted folder in the Photos app. This folder is the same as your computer’s Recycle Bin and retains the deleted photos for 30 days. Once this period expires, your photos are permanently deleted from this folder. Perform these steps if you want to recover recently deleted photos on your iPhone:

- Open the **Photos** app.
- Tap on **Albums** at the bottom.

**Note** – If you want to restore all the deleted photos from your **Recently Deleted** folder, tap on the **Recover All** button.

## **How to Recover Deleted Pictures on iPhone From a Backup?**

If your photos are not in the **Recently Deleted** folder, you might get them back by restoring your iPhone from a previous backup. There are three ways to restore deleted photos on iPhone – iCloud website, iTunes backup, or Finder.

When recovering photos from your iPhone from backup, pay attention to the date of creation of your backups. Use the most recent backup but don't delete all older backups. It's always good to have multiple backups if something goes wrong.

- Slow or unstable WiFi connection.
- Numerous unwanted backup files stored on iCloud.

Generally, restoring in progress doesn’t take more than 20 to 60 minutes for an iPhone to restart. Nonetheless, if restoring is stuck beyond that time, then be wary that it might take hours to finish. Anyhow, iPhone offers you ample options to get around a stuck iCloud backup.

### **How to restart an iPhone stuck at “Restore from iCloud- Time Remaining: Estimating”**

- Set up your iPhone and select Restore from iCloud Backup on the Apps & Data screen.
- You can also choose another restoration option- Transfer Directly from iPhone.
- Follow the instruction available on-screen to restore your iOS device.

If your new iPhone 14 continues getting stuck at iCloud restore progress, then you need to check your internet connection. Also, make sure the iOS device has adequate space to handle large volume of data you are trying to copy in it.

### **Check the iCloud System Status**

At rare occasions, even Apple server prevents the iCloud data restoration. The first thing you can do in such situations is to ascertain whether the restore process was stalled because of an internet issue or iCloud System Status. To do so, go to Apple system status page and check if iCloud Backup, Apple ID, and iCloud Account and Sign In, are working. If not, then you can’t do much but wait for Apple support to fix the issue at their end.

iCloud backup restore stuck while setting up a new iPhone 14 is not stressful until you lose a significant amount of data in the process. It is possible that in the search and trial of different options to restore iCloud backup on new iPhone 14, you might lose a significant amount of data.
