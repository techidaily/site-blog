## How to fix error 1015 while restoring iPhone

**Summary:** Error 1015 appears during iPhone restore through iTunes. If you are getting this error, its probably due to attempts of jailbreak or iPhone downgrade. This post shares 7 ways to fix iPhone restore error 1015 on iPhone 7, 8, XS, XR, SE, 11, 12, and above models.

Are you receiving iPhone error 1015 during restore with iTunes as below?

**Case 1:** _I have an old iPhone 3G stuck in Recovery Mode. I am trying to restore it through iTunes. But at the end of the restore, I get unknown error 1015. How can I fix error 1015 on my own?  
_

**Case 2:** _I tried to restore my iPhone in iTunes. It won’t finish because of this error 1015 code. I have the latest software. I’ve restarted and updated my iPhone too. Still the same error message appears._

Have you used tools like TinyUmbrella to restore firmware that Apple no longer supports?

Did you try to jailbreak your iPhone by using applications like Redsn0w or Pwnage?

If yes, that’s the reason behind the problem. The error 1015 is typically caused by attempts of jailbreak or downgrade on the iOS device. Such activities are a violation of the iOS end-user software license agreement. They can make your iPhone vulnerable to malware and prone to errors like 1015.

Naturally, Apple wouldn’t encourage jailbreak or downgrading to an older iOS version. Thus, you are bound to face problems when trying the unauthorized iOS modifications on your iPhone or iPad.

Thus, the probable reasons for the iPhone restore error 1015 are:

- Downgrade of iOS
- Jailbreak
- Outdated software
- Third-party tools on your computer

- Open iTunes
- Force restart your iPhone while it is still connected to the computer, until you see the iTunes logo (To force restart use home and/or volume button depending on your iPhone version)

After the Update process completes, you can restore your iPhone from iTunes or iCloud backup without facing the error 1015.

**Note:** If you are unable to enter Recovery Mode on your iPhone due to jailbreak, you may use programs like RecBoot, which are used to enter and exit the Recovery Mode on iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.

### **6\. Delete the IPSW file on your computer**

Files with _.ipsw_ extensions on your computer are backups and temporary files of your iOS updates. Many iPhone users who were receiving error 1015 while restoring iPhone were able to fix the problem by deleting these files on their PC or Mac.

**Note:** You can get rid of the old IPSW files and keep the most recent ones.

**On Windows XP:** C:\\Documents and Settings\\\[username\]\\Application Data\\Apple Computer\\iTunes\\iPhone Software Update

**On Windows Vista/7:** C:\\Users\\\[username\]\\AppData\\Roaming\\Apple Computer\\iTunes\\iPhone Software Updates

**On Mac OS X:** ~/Library/iTunes/iPhone Software Updates

### **7\. Restore your iPhone into DFU Mode**

As in Recovery Mode, bringing your iOS device to DFU mode will lead to loss of iPhone data. Thus, before you attempt this, make sure you have iCloud or iTunes backup.

- For 8 seconds, press and hold the Sleep button and Home button (iPhone 6s and below users) or the volume down button (iPhone 7). Next, release the Sleep button but continue to hold the Home button or the volume down button until iTunes shows message _‘iTunes has detected an iPhone in recovery mode._’

- Leave the Home button or volume down button. The iPhone screen turns black indicating the device has entered DFU mode

- Quickly press and release the volume up button, quickly press and release the volume down button, and press and hold the side button until your iPhone screen turns black

**Summary:** Many of the users have been wondering about the ways to restore deleted contacts. In this post, we shared the best methods to restore deleted contacts from your iPhone series 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, XS, XS Max, XR, X, 8, 7, 6, and 5.

 [![Free Download for Windows](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/free-download-windows.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/data-recovery-ios/ "Free Download for Windows")[![Free Download for Mac](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/free-download-Mac.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/data-recovery-ios/ "Free Download for Mac")

Losing contact names and numbers from the device all of a sudden is not new for iPhone users. Sometimes contact names are missing with only the random numbers visible, or the contact list is altogether empty. Mostly, the incidents occur after updating to a newer version of iOS, a bug in the device, accidental deletion, or else formatting of the iPhone.

You can always restore from iCloud or iTunes backup, but sometimes even those attempts might fail to recover deleted contacts. This can be because of wrong user names, passcodes, or device settings.

In such cases, the best way to restore only the missing contacts is to use **iPhone Data Recovery Software** by Stellar**.** Read on to know the four solutions to recover deleted contact on iPhone below.

If you have synced your iPhone to iCloud backup, restore missing contact names and numbers with this method.

- Go to your iPhone **Settings > iCloud > Contacts** (iOS 16 & 15 users follow: Settings > User Name > iCloud)

![how to restore contacts on iPhone from iCloud](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-8b4e845/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1-2.png)

- Toggle OFF and turn ON **Contacts** again

- It asks what you would like to do with the previously synced iCloud contacts on your iPhone. Select **Delete from My iPhone**.

You will get back lost contacts on the iPhone. Those accounts are also displayed in your group lists if you have different Cloud accounts like Gmail linked to your device. You can check and uncheck the group to view or hide, respectively.

This works only when you have backed up your iPhone to iTunes.

- Connect your iPhone to the PC
-  Launch iTunes
- Select your device from the Device list and pick the most recent backup entry date of your iPhone from the Summary page

![how to restore contacts on iPhone from iTunes Backup](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-8b4e845/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/iphone-backup.png)

- Click **Restore Backup**

You can get back the lost or deleted contacts from your iTunes backup. But the drawback of this method is that with iTunes, you do not have a choice to restore only the lost contacts on your iPhone selectively. This means that complete data from iTunes will be restored on your device, replacing existing iPhone data.

All current media photos, videos, messages, etc., on your iPhone will also be replaced by the iOS backup files. If you want to restore only contacts from iTunes backup, use a safe third-party iPhone data recovery application.

The best way to overcome the iTunes drawback and selectively restore only the missing contacts is to use [iPhone Contact Recovery](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/data-recovery-ios/) Software by Stellar.

This secure & do-it-yourself software recovers lost or accidentally deleted iPhone contacts, call history, etc., regardless of the cause of the loss.Experience the Free Trial version NOW!

- Go to your iPhone **Settings** > **Mail, Contacts, Calendars** > **Contacts**
- Click **Default Account**
- Select **iCloud** instead of **On my iPhone**
- Check if your phone’s missing contacts recovered

##  **To Wrap-up**

Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone intelligently restores your missing or accidentally deleted contacts without causing loss of iPhone’s existing data, unlike iTunes or iCloud Backup recovery methods. Changing the iPhone settings can also help you get back missing contacts. So now no need to worry about the contacts list loss. Instead, try the above methods and recover deleted contacts on your iPhone.
