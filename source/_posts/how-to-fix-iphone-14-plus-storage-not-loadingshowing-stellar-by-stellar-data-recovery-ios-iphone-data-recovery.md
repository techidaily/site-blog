## How can I use a computer to check my storage?

You can check your iPhone’s storage using a computer with iTunes or Finder app installed.

## How can I fix iPhone Storage Not Loading/Showing?

### 1\. Wait a bit more

Some computing operations take a while to finish. Your phone’s storage may overflow with tons of app data, images, and other files if you’ve been using it for a while.

And each of them would have to load before reporting their combined size to the OS. Usually, loading takes about three minutes.

### 2\. Update iOS

If your iOS version was outdated, your phone’s functionalities, including storage access, would not function properly. Additionally, updating the OS will get rid of any potential issues. Follow the procedures listed below to check and update your iOS version:

- Select **General** from the **Settings** menu.
- Click on **Software Update**. If any updates are available, **download** and **install** them.

![Updating software to resolve iPhone storage not loading and showing ](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/software-update-process-1024x576.png)

### 3\. Force Stops the App

The settings app itself can be the problem due to an app bug. Therefore, forcing the app to close is a valid option. This will make the software restart from scratch, wiping off part of the data and information it had in RAM.

- Access the **app switcher** (swipe up your finger from the bottom of the screen to bring up the menu or double-click the **Home** button on older iPhone models).

![App switcher](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/App-switcher.png)

- Swipe up and drag the **Settings card** off the screen to force the app to close.
- Relaunch the **Settings app** to see if the problem persists.

### 4\. Reconnect to iCloud

iOS has been designed in a way that it needs to be connected to iCloud to function flawlessly. Therefore, the storage loading error could also be linked to connectivity issues between these two. In this case, signing out of the service and then back in again might resolve the issue.

- Open the **Settings** application.
- Click your profile at the top. To sign out of the service, tap **iCloud**.

![Reconnecting to iCloud settings to fix iPhone storage not loading and showing](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/iCloud-settings.png)

- Next, sign in once more using your **iCloud password**.

### 5\. Fix the Issue Using Your PC

When you connect the cable, link your iPhone to your PC, and sync the storage, iTunes looks for any issues and either fixes them on its own or recommends methods to fix them by yourself. For any software-related issues with your phone, this is a great fix, and it may even repair your iPhone storage not updating problem.

- Connect your phone to computers that have **iTunes** installed on them with a lightning cord.
- The storage data should be able to sync with your smartphone automatically.
- If not, press the **Sync** button.

### 6\. Factory Reset Your iPhone

You may fix any bugs that cause iPhone storage not to update by performing a factory reset. Furthermore, it would restore your OS version to its factory settings, resolving any problems that updates might have brought on.

The whole contents of your device will be deleted if you follow this method. You can either create a backup of your data or use a tool to restore it once your iPhone has been entirely deleted to prevent this.

- Go **Settings app** on your smartphone. Next, choose **Reset** after choosing **General**.
- Under Reset, among the few options, click **Erase all Content and Settings**.

3. **Recover Apple ID and Password to reset iPhone**

**Important:** As Factory Reset deletes everything on iPhone, always backup your data before reset. If you haven’t and already reset your iOS device, you can download [Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/data-recovery-ios/) on your computer to restore the lost data due to factory reset.

### **Method 1: Use Recovery Mode to reset iPhone without Apple ID**

You can factory reset iPhone without Apple ID or password by using Recovery Mode. Make sure to have the latest iTunes installed on your already trusted computer.

#### **Steps to reset iPhone without Apple ID using Recovery Mode**

**Step 1:** Update iTunes on your PC/Mac to the latest version.

**Step 2:** Connect your iPhone/ iPad to the computer via USB cable.

**Step 3:** Put your iPhone/ iPad to **Recovery Mode**. _**Note:** The steps will vary with your iPhone/ iPad model._

**How to put your iPhone to Recovery Mode**

**iPhone 8, iPhone X, or later:** Press and quickly release the **Volume Up** button. Press and quickly release the **Volume Down** button. Then, press and hold the **Side** button until you see the recovery mode screen.

**iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, and iPod touch:** Press and hold the **Top (or Side)** and **Volume Down** buttons at the same time. Keep holding them until you see the Recovery Mode screen.

**iPhone 6s or earlier, iPad with Home button, and iPod touch:** Press and hold both the **Home** and the **Top (or Side)** buttons at the same time. Keep holding them until you see the recovery mode screen.

**iPad models that don’t have a Home button:** Press and quickly release the **Volume Up** button. Press and quickly release the **Volume Down** button. Press and hold the **Top** button until your device begins to restart. Continue holding the **Top** button until your device goes into Recovery Mode.

**Step 7:** Click **Restore** to confirm.

iTunes factory resets your iPhone without Apple ID. This will delete all your photos, videos, contacts, messages, chats and other data, same as in normal factory reset process using iPhone settings, which requires Apple ID.

### **Method 2: Reset iPhone without Apple ID via Stellar iPhone Eraser**

**<u><a href="https://www.stellarinfo.com/erase-iphone-data.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stellar iPhone Eraser</a></u>** software is another secure way to permanently erase complete iPhone data when you have forgotten Apple ID and password.  The software wipes iPhone as new without using the Apple ID.

Stellar iPhone Eraser is popularly used to reset iPhone before selling, donating, or exchanging so that no one can gain access to your personal data.

You can permanently delete photos, videos, audio, contacts, messages, passcodes, documents, third-party apps and other data from iPhone.

It sets the iOS device to the original factory settings. The software works with all iPhone variants including series of iPhone 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, XS MAX, XS, XR, X, 8, and below. It supports latest iOS 16 and below versions.

#### **Steps to reset iPhone without Apple ID using software:**

**Step 1:** Download and run Stellar Toolkit for iPhone on PC/Mac.

**Step 2**: Select **Erase Data**.

**Step 5:** Click **Erase**.

**Step 6:** In the **Erase Process** dialog box, select **Yes**.

**Step 7:** In **Data Erase Completes** dialog box, click **OK**.

All the data gets erased permanently beyond recovery from your iPhone or iPad.

### **Method 3: Recover forgotten Apple ID and Password to reset iPhone**

Apple ID password is necessary to use iPhone applications and services. So if you are not planning to sell off your iPhone or iPad, it is best to first recover the forgotten Apple ID password and then reset your iOS device using the **‘Erase All Content and Settings’** option in the iPhone Settings.

You can use iPhone Settings, Apple Support app, Find My iPhone, or visit [Apple account page](https://appleid.apple.com/)  to recover lost Apple ID password.

**[Click here to know in detail how to reset forgotten Apple ID and password.](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/how-to-recover-forgotten-apple-id-password/)**

Once you recover the Apple account password, follow the below steps to reset iPhone with the new Apple ID.

#### **Reset iPhone with Apple ID password:**

1. Go to **Settings > General > Reset.**
2. Click on **Erase All Content and Settings.**

![Reset option in iPhone](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-8b4e845/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-57.png)

### **Conclusion**

Without the Apple ID and password, you cannot reset your iOS device through the traditional ‘Erase All Content and Settings’ method. Either you recover the forgotten Apple ID and password or use any of the two methods shared above to factory reset the iPhone without Apple ID.

You can put the iPhone to Recovery Mode and use iTunes on your computer to reset the iOS device without Apple ID. Other than this, a simpler way to permanently delete everything on your iPhone is by using Stellar iPhone Eraser software. The software doesn’t ask for Apple ID through the process. It quickly resets your iPhone or iPad and brings it to original settings by erasing complete data on it.
