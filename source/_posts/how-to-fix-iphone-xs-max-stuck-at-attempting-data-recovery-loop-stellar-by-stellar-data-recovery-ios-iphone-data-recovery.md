Losing contact names and numbers from the device all of a sudden is not new for iPhone users.

Mostly, the incidents occur after updating to a newer version of iOS, a bug in the device, accidental deletion, or else formatting of the iPhone.

You can always restore from iCloud or iTunes backup, but sometimes even those attempts might fail to recover deleted contacts. This can be because of wrong user names, passcodes, or device settings.

You can get back the lost or deleted contacts from your iTunes backup.
