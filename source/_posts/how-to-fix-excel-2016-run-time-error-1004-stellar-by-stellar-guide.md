VBA (Microsoft Visual Basic for Application) is an internal programming language in Microsoft Excel. Sometimes, when users try to run VBA or generate a Macro in Excel, the Run-time error 1004 may occur. This error may occur due to the presence of more legend entries in the chart, file conflict, incorrect Macro name, and corrupt Excel files. In this blog, we have discussed the reasons and shared some solutions to resolve run-time error 1004.

## **Why This Error Occurs?**

The run time error 1004 usually occurs when you run a VBA macro with the Legend Entries method to modify the legend entries in the MS Excel chart. It happens when the chart contains more legend entries than the available space, macro name conflicts, corrupt Excel files, or data-types mismatch in the VBA code.

## **Ways to Fix Excel Run-Time Error 1004?**

Try the below workarounds to fix Excel run-time error 1004:

### **Create a Macro to Reduce Chart Legend Font Size**

Sometimes, Excel throws the run-time error when you try to run VBA macro to change the legend entries in a Microsoft Excel chart. This error usually occurs when Microsoft Excel truncates the legend entries because of the more legend entries and less space availability. To fix this, try to create a macro that shrinks/minimize the font size of the Excel chart legend text before the VBA macro, and then restore the font size of the chart legend. Here is the macro code:

```
VBCopy
Sub ResizeLegendEntries()

With Worksheets("Sheet1").ChartObjects(1).Activate
      ' Store the current font size
      fntSZ = ActiveChart.Legend.Font.Size

'Temporarily change the font size.
      ActiveChart.Legend.Font.Size = 2

'Place your LegendEntries macro code here to make
         'the changes that you want to the chart legend.

' Restore the font size.
      ActiveChart.Legend.Font.Size = fntSZ
   End With

End Sub
Note: Make sure you have an Excel chart to run the code on the worksheet.
```

## \[Fixed\] Excel PivotTable Overlap Error | Troubleshooting Guide

In Excel, you need to refresh the pivot table data source after adding new data. However, sometimes, while refreshing the pivot table, you may experience an error “PivotTable Report cannot Overlap.” This issue usually appears when there are multiple pivot tables in a single worksheet. It often occurs when you try to place one pivot table on top of another or if you try to set a common cell range to multiple pivot tables. However, there are many other causes associated with the error.

## **Reasons for a pivot table report cannot overlap another pivot table report issue:**

- Merged cells in a pivot table may cause the overlap issue
- Using the same range of cells for multiple pivot tables
- Hidden columns
- Preserve formatting option is enabled
- Modifying the pivot table using a macro that is corrupted
- Using the workbook.RefreshAll method incorrectly
- Number of pivot items goes beyond the number of cells available
- Excel file is corrupt
- [Corrupted Pivot table](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/)
- Some columns are labeled with the same name

## Methods to Fix Excel PivotTable Report Cannot Overlap Error

You can get the pivot table overlapping issue if the field in pivot table crossed the maximum items limit. According to the Microsoft guide, you can specify up to 1,048,576 items to return per field. Check the cell fields in your pivot table. Also, make sure each column’s label is unique. Sometimes, the hidden columns or hidden sheets can also prevent you from modifying the pivot tables. You can check for hidden columns in the Data view.

If the error still persists, then try the below-mentioned methods to fix the error.

### **1\. Move the Pivot Table to a New Worksheet**

The “PivotTable Report cannot Overlap” error can occur if there is an issue with the columns in the pivot table. In this case, you can try moving the pivot table to a new worksheet. Moving the pivot table to a different worksheet automatically resets the column width according to the new sheet and creates space that can help in preventing the overlapping issue. Here are the steps to do so:

### **2\. Disable the Background Refresh Option**

When the background refresh option is enabled, then Excel updates the pivot table in the background after every minor change. It may create issue if you have a large-sized Excel file with multiple pivot tables. You can try disabling the background refresh option. Here’s how:

- The **Connection Properties** dialog box is displayed. Unselect the “**Enable background refresh”** option and select the **“Refresh data when opening the file”**
- Click **OK.  

    ![enable background refresh in connection properties window](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/Recover-Excel-Files/pivottable/enable-background-refresh-in-connection-properties-window.jpg)

    **

### **3\. Disable Autofit Column Widths**

When the Autofit column widths option is enabled, Excel automatically resizes the pivot table whenever you make changes to it. These automatic adjustments can sometimes add or remove fields which can result in the PivotTable Report cannot Overlap issue. To fix this, you can disable the “Autofit column widths on update” option. To do this, follow these steps:

- Right-click on any field on the pivot table.
- Select **PivotTable Options.  

    ![Select Pivot Table](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/Recover-Excel-Files/pivottable/select-pivot-table.jpg)

- Click on the **OK.**

### **4\. Check the Workbook.RefreshAll Method**

Several users have reported experiencing the “Excel PivotTable Report cannot Overlap” error when using the Workbook.RefreshAll method. This method is used to refresh data ranges in the pivot report. Sometimes, the error can occur due to missing variable that is representing an object (workbook) in a query. So, make sure you’re using the Workbook.RefreshAll function correctly.

It also mentions the Stellar Repair for Excel to fix the saving error if it is due to corruption in the Excel file.

[![Free Download for Windows](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/free-download-windows.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/ "Free Download for Windows")

It is easy to work with Microsoft Excel but sometimes, the application may create issues thereby hampering the smooth functioning of the workbook. One such issue is “unable to Save Excel Workbook”.

## Let’s take a look at the issue of Unable to Save Excel Workbook

### **Instance 1:**

In an organization, users connected to one of the servers (Windows 2008 R2) using Citrix – a Terminal Server configured with Windows 2008 R2 –and accessed their data through a File Server, also configured with Windows 2008R2. Since the connectivity to Shared Drive was established through a Terminal server, any conflict amongst the server configuration may create conflict in shared file.

This issue was discussed at length at one of the [Tech Forums](https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/371563-excel-document-not-saved-issue), where the users were unable to access their workbooks stored on the shared drive. The File menu did not work. As a result, the users were forced to save the workbook by creating quick access shortcuts or locally on the desktop. In many cases, the saving option was ruled out completely.

### **Instance 2:**

A [similar problem](https://www.dell.com/support/article/in/en/indhs1/sln308103/unable-to-save-workbook-in-microsoft-excel?lang=en) was reported, wherein the users received an error when saving an Excel workbook after inserting a chart in an existing workbook (previously saved) or copying values from an existing workbook. A system is configured with Windows 7 and Microsoft Office 10 configuration. The issue arises when the user is unable to save the changes after editing in a saved spreadsheet. The following message displays on the screen:

![Image of Error message while trying to save excel file](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Excel-Error.png)

Figure: Unable to Save Excel WorkBook Issue

**Further, if the user clicks ‘Continue’, the following error message is received:**

“Excel encountered errors during save. However, Excel was able to minimally save your file to <**filename.xlsx**\>”.

**Note:** This issue impacts build Version 1707 (Build 8326.2086) and later, and also only occurs with files that are stored locally, such as on the desktop. This problem does not occur if you manually enter values or insert a chart in a newly created workbook.

## Plausible reasons for the ‘Unable to save Excel workbook’ Issue

1. The issue was detected in Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2010 32-bit, Service Pack 14.0.6029.1000.
2. Excel version on the user system may or may not match with Excel version on File server.
3. The issue of ‘Unable to Save Excel Workbook’ impacts only the Build Version 1707 (Build 8326.2086) and later.
4. In case of Issue 2, the problem surfaces when the user adds files, tables or charts in the locally saved excel files, such as on the desktop.

## Methods to fix the ‘Unable to Save Excel Workbook’ Issue

There may be an issue with the Build version or the Registry Values settings may not be appropriate, which does not allow the Excel workbooks to save.

**But, before starting to resolve the issue, verify the following:**

1. **The location where the file is to be saved may not have enough space to save the Excel file**: Check the available space and save again. You may also use the option of ‘Save As’ to save the file at a new location.
2. **Excel file may be a shared one where edits are not allowed by a specific user**: There are restrictions attached to documents and other files shared over the network. Check for these restrictions.
3. **Antivirus may interrupt in during file saving**: Antivirus in the system may not allow saving of the files. Request the system administrator to uninstall the antivirus and reinstall after saving.
4. **The file is not saved within 218 characters**: If the file is not saved due to the naming issue, then check the character length and try again.
5. **Differences in Windows versions** of the local system and those on network drive may cause excel not saved issues. Check that all the systems have the same configuration and are updated to the recently available versions.
6. **Excel spreadsheet is corrupt**: If none of the above factors have not caused hindrance in saving the file, then there may be a probability of [corruption in the Excel spreadsheet](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/simple-way-to-open-corrupt-excel-file-without-any-backup/).

Once verified, look for a healthy and restorable backup. If backup is missing, resolve the issue of “Unable to open Excel File” with manual settings on local system or through a reliable Excel repair software.

## **Conclusion**

‘Unable to save Excel file’ is a generic problem that may appear due to various reasons. In this blog post, we presented some of the actual instances reported by users on community forums.

Windows updates, the Build versions, the Service Packs of the local systems and those on the network drive must be either similar or in sync with each other. Any deviation may cause issues in accessing or saving the Microsoft files, as reported in Instance 1 is caused where user is unable to save Microsoft Excel file on the Network Drive. In case, the user is unable to save the file on network drive then the problem lies with the Registry value.
