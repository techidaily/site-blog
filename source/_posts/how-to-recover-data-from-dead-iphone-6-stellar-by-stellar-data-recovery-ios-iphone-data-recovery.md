## How to recover data from dead iPhone

**Summary:** Recovering data from a dead iPhone is precarious if you don’t acquire knowledge about your iOS device. Be wary of how your device works and its data backup options to avert data loss problems in the future. If your iPhone has turned dead because of a major technical glitch, you can recover the data stored in it using a reliable data recovery software. This blog encapsulates all such concrete details with a step-by-step guide to recover data from dead iPhone.

iPhone is one of the most affluent smartphones loaded with advanced features. Most people invest in it because its upbeat features and advanced technology intrigue them. Every time Apple announces a new upgrade or introduces new features to its iOS software upgrade, iPhone fans dig deep to learn more about it.

If your iPhone is dead and not working at all, and you want to learn how to recover data from dead iPhone, this blog is exclusively for you.

## **Why would an iPhone suddenly go dead?**

These are the possible reasons why iPhone turns dead or blank for hours:

1. A defective charging cable or adapter that doesn’t perfectly pair with your iOS device.
2. A recent iOS update that triggered some unforeseen software error in your iPhone.
3. Faulty or failed hardware, like a battery or a logic board that needs to be replaced.

In either of the above-mentioned conditions, your iPhone will stop responding to any command. Turning the device off and restarting works in rare circumstances, but not always. In such bleak situations, you can try to fix your dead iPhone using these tips:

- Keep a close watch over the charging cable or power adapter and fix the loose ends.
- Put your dead iPhone on charge for at least an hour.
- Connect your iPhone to iTunes or put it on Device Firmware Update (DFU) mode.
- Seek immediate assistance from Apple Support Services.

If these attempts won’t bring your iPhone back to life, certainly it has some major technical glitch that only Apple experts can address. Before submitting your device for the same, recover all the data stored in it. Follow these DIY solutions to **recover data from dead iPhone**:

### **Use iTunes to Recover Data from Dead iPhone**

iTunes is one of the most coveted options to **recover data recovery from dead iPhone**. However, to use this method, your iPhone should be in sync with iTunes, and you have to periodically take data backup on it. Observe the steps to keep data backup on iTunes:

- Connect your iPhone to your computer and open iTunes to login.
- From the menu bar at the top of the iTunes window, select **File > Library > Organize** **Library**.
- Next, select **Consolidate files** to organize the Library screen and press **OK**.
- Once you do that, copies of any files that were not in the iTunes Media folder will be added to your iTunes Media folder.
- At the same time, take the opportunity to eliminate all the duplicate files taking unnecessary space on your hard drive. However, before making this move, save a copy of the original files in your iTunes Media Folder.

- Once selected, the desired number of files/data to restore, press **Restore**, and wait. The move may restart your iPhone. If not, your device will suffer a more serious hardware failure that only technical experts can fix.

**Pro Tip:** _If found dead, let your iPhone remain off for as long as possible to avoid data overwriting._

### **Use iCloud to Recover Data from Dead iPhone**

If you are proactively using iCloud to maintain data backup, there is a fair chance to recover your dead phone’s data from it. You can directly recover data from iCloud on another iPhone that doesn’t necessarily require connection to a laptop or computer. All you need is an iPhone that can be turned on at least and let you through the initial steps to login to your iCloud. Don’t forget to erase your dead iPhone before continuing on the new one; otherwise, you won’t get to perform the initial set-up. Follow the steps below to restore dead iPhone’s data from iCloud Backup:

- Turn on the working iPhone and perform the initial setup procedures till you get through **Apps & Data**. Tap on **Restore from iCloud Backup** option and sign in with your Apple ID.

- Patiently wait for the data transfer procedure to finish.
- In the data transfer procedure, at some point, you might be asked to enter your Apple ID once again. Enter details to keep the action going.
