Several Microsoft Excel users have reported encountering the ‘Excel file not opening’ error when opening their Excel file. There are several reasons that may cause this error. In this post, we’ll be discussing the reasons that may lead to the ‘Excel file not opening’ error and the top 5 ways to fix this error.

## Why Does the ‘Excel File Not Opening’ Error Appear?

Following are some possible causes that may result in the ‘Excel file not opening’ error:

1. There may be a problem with an add-in that is preventing you from opening the Excel files.
2. There’s a chance that your Excel application is faulty.

If you are experiencing the ‘Excel found a problem with one or more formula references in this worksheet’ error message in the Excel workbook, it indicates that the [Excel file is corrupt](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/) or partially damaged. However, it may also occur due to incorrect reference to a wrong cell or object linking, which is not working. The complete error message says,

_‘Excel found a problem with one or more formula references in this worksheet. Check that the cell references, range names, defined names, and links to other workbooks in your formulas are all correct.’_

![Excel found a problem with one or more formula references](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MS-Excel-problem-with-formula-reference.png)

In any case, resolving the error is critical as it doesn’t let you save the file and may result in loss of information from the Excel workbook.

## Reasons for Excel Formula References Error

A few reasons that may lead to such error are as follows,

- Wrong formula or reference cell
- Incorrect object linking or link embedding OLE
- Empty or no values in named or range cells
- Multiple Excel files (not common)

## Methods to Resolve ‘Excel Found a Problem with One or More Formula References in this Worksheet’ Error

Following are a few methods that you can follow to [fix Excel file](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/) that can’t be saved due to problems with one or more formula references in the worksheet.

### Method 1: Check Formulas

If the problem has occurred in a large Excel workbook with multiple sheets, it’s quite hard to pinpoint the problem cell. In such cases, you can use the Error Checking option that runs a scan and checks for a problem with formulas used in the worksheet.

To run Error Checking in the Excel sheet, follow these steps,

- Go to Formulas and click on the ‘Error Checking’ button

![Error Checking](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MS-Excel-error-checking-1024x431.png)

- This runs a scan on the sheet and displays the issues, if any. If no issue is found, it displays the following message,

_The error check is completed for the entire sheet._

In such a case, you can try saving the Excel file again. If the error message persists, proceed to the next method.

### Method 2: Check Individual Sheet

The problem may also occur due to an issue with one of the sheets in the workbook. To find the faulty sheet and fix the problem, you can copy each sheet content in a new Excel file and then try to save the Excel file.

This will help you find the faulty sheet from the workbook that you can review. This method makes the entire [process of troubleshooting Excel formula](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/) reference error quite easy and convenient.

In case the error is not fixed, you can back up the faulty sheet content and remove it from the workbook to save the Excel file.

### Method 3: Check Links

When the Excel file contains external links with errors, MS Excel may display such error messages. To check and confirm if external links are causing the error, follow these steps,

- Navigate to _Data Tab > Queries & Connections > Edit Links_
- Check the links. If you find any faulty link, remove it and then save the sheet

### Method 4: Review Charts

You can review the charts to check if they are causing the formula reference error in Excel. It may take a while based on the size of the Excel file. Sometimes, it’s not practically possible to track down which Excel chart object is causing the error. Thus, you need to check specific locations, such as:

1. Check horizontal axis formula inside Select Data Source dialog box
2. Check Secondary Axis
3. Check linked Data Labels, Axis Labels, or Chart Title

### Method 5: Check Pivot Tables

To check Pivot Tables, follow these steps,

- Navigate to _PivotTable Tools > Analyze > Change Data Source > Change Data Source…_

![Edit links](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MS-Excel-Edit-Links-1024x84.png)

- Check if any of the formula used is problematic. Sometimes small typo, such as misplaced comma, can lead to such problems in Excel. Thus, check each formula thoroughly and correct the formulas wherever needed.

### Method 6: Use Excel Repair Software

When none of the methods resolve the error, then you can rely on advanced [Excel repair software](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/), such as Stellar Repair for Excel. It’s a powerful tool that is recommended by several MVPs and IT administrators for resolving common Excel errors, such as ‘Excel found a problem with one or more formula references in this worksheet.’

## Conclusion

Although the error ‘Excel found a problem with one or more formula references in this worksheet’ can be resolved by using various options in MS Excel, it may lead to a partial loss of information. Thus, you must perform these operations after taking a backup of the Excel worksheet. Also, if the MS Excel options fail to resolve the problem, you can use an Excel file repair software, such as Stellar Repair for Excel. The software helps fix Excel file corruption and restores the information and data from corrupt or damaged Excel files (.xls/.xlsx) to a new worksheet.




## Resolve Compile Error in Hidden Module in Excel: Causes & Solutions

The hidden module in Excel refers to a container with VBA codes, custom queries, and complex macros. The compile error in a hidden (protected) module in the Excel worksheet usually occurs when doing different activities on a macro-enabled sheet, such as merging .xls files. The error can result in macros execution failure. You need to quickly resolve this compile error to restore full functionality of the VBA code. Below, we’ll be discussing the solutions to fix this Excel error. But before that, let’s see why this error occurs.

You may encounter the Compile error in hidden module due to one of the following reasons:

- The code in the workbook is not compatible with the Excel application.
- Manual queries created in a previous version are no longer compatible with your current version of Excel.
- Missing references.
- Invalid .exe files (control information cache files) are automatically created with ActiveX control insertion in Excel file.
- Protected module is corrupted.
- The workbook with hidden module is damaged or corrupted.
- Incompatible add-ins.
- Incompatible Excel file version.
- The module is protected or password-protected.
- Missing or corrupted mscomctl.ocx file.

Excel can throw the compile error while compiling the code that exists in the protected module. So, first check the error and identify the hidden module that is creating the issue. You can unprotect the module. Also, ensure that you have permission to access the VBA code in the module. If the error still exists, follow the below troubleshooting methods.

### Method 1: Re-register ActiveX Control Files or mscomctl.ocx Files

You can get the compile error in the Excel file, containing the VBA code related to ActiveX controls or OCX files. The ActiveX control files and OCX files (mscomctl.ocx files) are the components of Microsoft’s standard controls library. The compile error in the hidden module can occur if these files are missing. In this case, you can use the Regsvr32 tool to re-register the OCX files. The [Regsvr32](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/topic/how-to-use-the-regsvr32-tool-and-troubleshoot-regsvr32-error-messages-a98d960a-7392-e6fe-d90a-3f4e0cb543e5) is a command-line utility to register and unregister OLE controls in the Windows registry.

### Method 2: Delete .exd Files

 The .exd files are temporary files created by Excel when inserting ActiveX controls objects. These temporary files can lead to a compile error if they are corrupted. So, if this issue has occurred, particularly in the Excel file containing ActiveX controls, then deleting .exd files might fix the issue. To delete the .exd file, follow the below steps:

- First, open the **Run** window by pressing the Windows+R keys.

![Open The Run Window](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/open-the-run-window.jpg)

- In the **Run** window, type **%appdata%**.

![Type App Data Command](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/type-app-data-command.jpg)

- In the **Roaming** window, click on the **Microsoft** option.

![Click On Microsoft Option Under Roaming](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/click-on-microsoft-option-under-roaming.jpg)

- Under **Microsoft**, you will see a list of folders. Search and click on **Forms.**
- Right-click on a file with .exd extension and select **Delete**.
- Once you delete the .exd files, restart your Excel application.

### Method 3: Rollback the Office Updates

MS Office updates or upgrades may also cause the compile error in hidden module in Excel. If the error has occurred after downloading the recent Microsoft Office updates, try [reverting to the previous version](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/how-to-revert-to-an-earlier-version-of-office-2bd5c457-a917-d57e-35a1-f709e3dda841) or uninstalling the recent updates to fix the issue.

### Method 4: Unselect Missing References

The compile error in hidden module determine path in Excel can also occur if your file contains a reference to object library/type library, which is labelled as Missing. You can locate, check, and uncheck the references marked as ‘Missing’ to fix the issue. Here are the steps:

- Open your **Excel** and press **Alt + F11** keys.
- The **Visual Basic Editor** is displayed.

![Visual Basic Editor](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/visual-basic-editor.jpg)

- Go to the **Tools** option and then click **References**.

![Click On References Under Tools Option](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/click-on-references-under-tools-option.jpg)

- In the **References-VBAProject** window, under **Available References**, search and unselect the references starting as “Missing”.

![Unselect Missing References](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/unselect-missing-references.jpg)

- Click **OK**.

### Method 5: Check the Code in Module

The compile error in hidden module can occur if there are issues in the code within the module. The problems include incorrect or missing syntaxes, missing parameters/references, or the code contains incompatible functions or a wrong name of the object. You can check and fix these issues in the code by opening the VBA editor.

### Method 6: Check and Remove Add-ins

In Excel, the compile error in macro-enabled files can also occur due to incompatible add-ins. You can check and disable the **add-ins** in Excel using the below steps:

- First, open the **Run** window and type excel /safe and then click **OK**. The Excel application will open in safe mode.
- Now try to open the affected Excel file. If it opens without the error, then check and remove the latest installed Excel add-ins.
- Navigate to the **File** option and then select **Options**.
- In the **Excel Options** window, click **Add-ins**.

![Click Addins Select Latest Addins](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/click-add-ins-select-latest-add-ins.jpg)

- Under **Add-ins**, search and select the latest add-ins, and then click on **Go**.
