You don’t get the details like the content of the conversation or whether your call was answered or not.

Nevertheless, you can contact Apple requesting for FaceTime call logs by clicking on this link and submitting the request – [Read More](https://www.apple.com/privacy/contact/)

Apple will get back to you.
