But the method to bring an iPhone in DFU or Recovery Mode varies in each iPhone model and iPad.

This post will guide you on how to enter and exit Recovery and DFU Modes in different iPhone and iPad variants. But first, understand what these iPhone functions are and their uses.

![How to Put iPhone or iPad on recovery mode](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-8b4e845/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Reamp_How-to-Enter-Recovery-or-DFU-Mode_edited-Clean.jpg)

## **What is Recovery Mode and its use?**

Recovery Mode uses iBoot to upgrade or restore your iPhone. iBoot is a bootloader program for iOS devices. Recovery Mode helps install the same or above iOS firmware version already on your iPhone. The iPhone screen in Recovery Mode prompts to connect iPhone to iTunes, showing a computer image.

Recovery Mode helps fix iPhone updates or restore issues, such as [iPhone stuck at the Apple logo](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/how-to-fix-an-iphone-stuck-on-the-apple-logo/), unable to open the locked iPhone or want to reset iPhone but [forgot iPhone passcode](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/forgot-iphone-password-best-solutions/).

## **What is DFU Mode and its use?**

Device Firmware Update or DFU mode lets your iPhone connect with iTunes on the computer without iBoot. As DFU mode doesn’t use iBoot, you can make changes in the operating system of the iOS device. An iPhone in DFU mode has a completely black screen.

Putting iPhone into DFU mode is the solution when Recovery Mode doesn’t resolve the problem. DFU mode can restore or upgrade iPhone. This mode is also commonly used to downgrade or [jailbreak iPhone](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/how-to-jailbreak-iphone-without-data-loss/)s.

### **Caution — you may lose all your iPhone data!**

If you are entering DFU mode, make sure to [back up your iPhone data](https://support.apple.com/en-in/guide/iphone/iph3ecf67d29/ios). DFU mode [permanently erases iPhone data](https://www.stellarinfo.com/erase-iphone-data.php). So always back up your videos, photos, messages, chats, Notes, etc., either to iCloud or iTunes.

However, if you have lost iPhone data and don’t have a backup, then immediately download iPhone data recovery software — [Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/data-recovery-ios/). The software helps to restore lost or deleted iPhone contacts, call logs, photos, videos, text, FaceTime, audio, chats, Calendar, Notes, Safari bookmarks, etc. It is quick to recover and extremely user-friendly.

- Click **Restore Backup**

### **4\. Contact Apple**

Apple uses end-to-end encryption in FaceTime calls. It will not decrypt the content of your conversations. Apple may record and store information, such as to whom you had called and your iPhone/ iPad network configurations. It stores this information for up to 30 days. You don’t get the details like the content of the conversation or whether your call was answered or not.

Nevertheless, you can contact Apple requesting for FaceTime call logs by clicking on this link and submitting the request – [Read More](https://www.apple.com/privacy/contact/)

Apple will get back to you.

## **Conclusion**

iCloud and iTunes backup are the natural way for Apple users to recover FaceTime deleted call history. However, Apple’s solution though workable is not efficient when it comes to the recovery of specific types of data. The iTunes or iCloud backup recovery methods replace every existing data on your iPhone with an old/recent backup. You lose your current photos, videos, call history, messages, chats, etc.

Whereas [Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/data-recovery-ios/) tackles this recovery issue more effectively. It recovers lost FaceTime calls and also keeps your current data intact on the iPhone.

The software works in all data loss situations due to deletion, jailbreak, water damage, factory reset, etc. You can restore FaceTime call history from any iPhone including series of iPhone 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, X, XS, XR, iPhone 8, iPhone 7, iPhone 6 and older versions. It is available for both Windows and macOS computers.

## Apple will delete your photos in July. Here’s what you should do

Apple has recently announced that it will permanently delete photos from its users' **'My Photo Stream'** this month. This news has come as a surprise to the Apple community, as users struggle to understand the implications of this announcement and what necessary precautions can be taken. In this blog post, we will get into the details of this new move by Apple, explore the reasons behind it, and provide tips on how iPhone/iPad/Mac users can safeguard their precious photos.

## **The Announcement**

_"__My Photo Stream is scheduled to be shut down on July 26, 2023._ _As part of this transition, new photo uploads to My Photo Stream from your devices will stop one month before, on June 26, 2023._

The photos in My Photo Stream are already stored on at least one of your devices, so as long as you have the device with your originals, you won't lose any photos as part of this process. If a photo you want isn't already in your Library on a particular iPhone, iPad, or Mac, make sure that you save it to your Library on that device…” [Read more](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210705)

## **What is Apple's My Photo Stream?**

My Photo Stream, launched in 2011, was designed to sync photos across multiple Apple devices such as iPhone, iPad, or Mac.

This feature automatically stores your most recent pictures (up to 1000) for approx. 30 days so you can view and download them easily from other Apple devices. After this period, photos are removed from My Photo Stream but remain in your device's Photos app. However, this only shows photos and not your live images or videos.

## **How to Protect Your 'My Photo Stream' Pictures?**

Apple, known for its commitment to user privacy and data security, has recommended several preventive measures to mitigate the risk of losing any important photo due to this update.

### 1\. Move My Photo Stream images to your Library

Even if the pictures in My Photo Stream are already there on at least one of your Apple devices, you must save these pictures to your Photo Library to avoid losing them**.** Here's how to copy My Photo Stream pictures to your Photo Library:

**On your iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch:**

- Open the Photos app and tap Albums.
- Tap on **My Photo Stream > Select**.
- Select all the photos you want to save, then tap the **Share** button > **Save Image**.

**On your Mac:**

- Open the **Photos** app and then open the **My Photo Stream**
- Select the photos you want to save which aren't currently in your photo library.
- Drag and drop them from the **My Photo Stream** album into your Library.

### 2\. Move to iCloud Photos

To preserve your My Photo Stream images in their original and high-resolution version, you can transfer them to iCloud Photos.

If you already have an iCloud account, just enable iCloud Photos to automatically upload & sync every photo and video you capture on the device, making them accessible from anywhere.

To use the iCloud Photos service, you will require the following:

- iPhone running iOS 8.3 or later version.
- iPad with iPadOS 8.3 or later version.
- Mac running OS X Yosemite or later version.

#### **How to set up iCloud Photos on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch?**

- On your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, go to **Settings**.
- Next, click on \[**Your** **Name**\] > **iCloud**.
- Tap on **Photos** and do the following:

For **iOS 16, iPadOS 16, or later** versions: Toggle on the '**Sync this \[device\]**' option.

![setup icloud photos on iPhone](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/data-recovery/apple-iphone-permanently-delete-photos/setup-icloud.jpg)

For **iOS 15, iPadOS 15, or earlier** versions: Turn on the **iCloud Photos**

#### **How to set up iCloud Photos on your Mac?**

- On your **Mac**, go to **Apple** **Menu** and click on **System** **Preferences**.
- Click **Apple** **ID** and then select **iCloud** in the sidebar.
- Now, select **Photos** and turn on the **switch** next to **Sync** **this** **Mac**.

**

## **Don't want to use iCloud Photos?**

While iCloud Photos is a convenient option for many Apple users, it's important to acknowledge that it is not the best fit for everyone. Limited free storage of 5GB or lack of cross-platform compatibility can compel Apple users to look for other alternatives.

Storage options, such as Google Photos, Microsoft OneDrive, Dropbox, external hard drives, etc., are available to ensure your iPhone Photos are safe and easily accessible.

## **The Bottom Line**

Apple's announcement of the potential discontinuation of My Photo Stream has understandably caused worry among its users. While a specific reason for this action remains undisclosed, they are actively addressing the issue to prevent data loss. In the meantime, iPhone users must take precautionary measures to safeguard their photos. They can simply move the My Photo Stream images to the Photo Library, iCloud Photos, or other backup folders.
