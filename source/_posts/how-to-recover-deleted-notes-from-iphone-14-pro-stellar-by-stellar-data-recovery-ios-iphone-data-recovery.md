### **4\. Contact Apple**

Apple uses end-to-end encryption in FaceTime calls. It will not decrypt the content of your conversations. Apple may record and store information, such as to whom you had called and your iPhone/ iPad network configurations. It stores this information for up to 30 days. You don’t get the details like the content of the conversation or whether your call was answered or not.

Nevertheless, you can contact Apple requesting for FaceTime call logs by clicking on this link and submitting the request – [Read More](https://www.apple.com/privacy/contact/)

Apple will get back to you.

## **Conclusion**

iCloud and iTunes backup are the natural way for Apple users to recover FaceTime deleted call history. However, Apple’s solution though workable is not efficient when it comes to the recovery of specific types of data. The iTunes or iCloud backup recovery methods replace every existing data on your iPhone with an old/recent backup. You lose your current photos, videos, call history, messages, chats, etc.

Whereas [Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/data-recovery-ios/) tackles this recovery issue more effectively. It recovers lost FaceTime calls and also keeps your current data intact on the iPhone.

The software works in all data loss situations due to deletion, jailbreak, water damage, factory reset, etc. You can restore FaceTime call history from any iPhone including series of iPhone 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, X, XS, XR, iPhone 8, iPhone 7, iPhone 6 and older versions. It is available for both Windows and macOS computers.
