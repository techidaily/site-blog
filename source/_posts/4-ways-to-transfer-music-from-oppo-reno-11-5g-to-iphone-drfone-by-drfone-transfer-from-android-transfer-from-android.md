The interface will provide a preview of your data so that you can choose the files you wish to move. To learn how to transfer music from Oppo Reno 11 5G to iPhone selectively, follow these steps:

1. Install and open the Dr.Fone toolkit on your computer and click on the “Phone Manager” option from the home screen.

In this way, you can selectively transfer music from Oppo Reno 11 5G to iPhone in a hassle-free manner.

## Part 3: How to transfer music from Oppo Reno 11 5G to iPhone using Android File Transfer?

If you use a Mac, then you can use Android File Transfer to move your data from your Oppo Reno 11 5G to your system. Though, to transfer music from Oppo Reno 11 5G to iPhone, you would later need to take the assistance of iTunes. This is because you can’t simply drag and drop your data from your system to the iPhone. While the solution is free, it is certainly quite complicated and is not direct like Dr.Fone.

1. To start with, download and install Android File Transfer from its official [website](https://www.android.com/filetransfer/) on your Mac. It is compatible with macOS 10.7 and higher versions.
