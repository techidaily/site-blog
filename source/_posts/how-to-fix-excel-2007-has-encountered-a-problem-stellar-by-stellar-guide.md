## How to Fix the #Value! Error in Excel?

**Summary:** #Value! is a common error that occurs when using formulas in Excel. It can be due to an issue with the cells you are referencing or use of formulas in the wrong type or format. This blog will discuss some cases when this error may occur and the solutions to fix the issue. You’ll also find about an Excel repair software that can help fix the error if it has occurred due to corruption in Excel file.

[![Free Download for Windows](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/free-download-windows.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/ "Free Download for Windows")

You may experience the #Value! error in Excel when trying to enter invalid data type into the formulas. Sometimes, it appears when a value is not the expected type or when dates are given a text value. This Excel error may occur due to several reasons. However, the exact cause of this error is difficult to find. Below, we will be discussing some cases where you may get this error and the solutions to resolve the issues.

## Case 1: Wrong Argument Data Type in Formulas

Sometimes, Excel throws the “#Value!” error if it recognizes incompatible arguments in the formulas.

For example: The Date function in the sheet expects only numerical values as arguments. In the below image you can see that when the formula’s string value is used in the month (January), it resulted in the #VALUE! error.

![Image of #Value! error in Date Function](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/date-function-error.png)

**Solution**

To fix the issue,

- Double-click the formula to verify the type of arguments.

![Image of Solution to fix #Value! error in Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/verify-type-of-arguments-in-formulas.png)

- Correct the argument in the cell (B2).

![Image of Correcting Argument In Cell to fix #Value! error in Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/correcting-argument-in-the-cell.png)

The formula will work as expected.

## Case 2: Using the Basic Subtraction Formula

Users often experience the #Value! error, when using the basic subtraction formula in Excel.

![Image of #Value! error in Excel in Subtraction Formula ](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/subtraction-formula-error-window.png)

**Solution**

Check the formula and the type of values in the cell. If these are correct and the error persists, then follow these steps:

![Image of Correcting Basic Subtraction Formula to fix #Value! error in Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/correcting-basic-subtraction-formula.png)

- Go to the **Start** button on Windows, type **Control Panel**, and double-click on it.
- Click **Clock and Region > Region.**

![Image of Clock And Region Window in Control Panel to #Value! error in Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/clock-and-region-window.png)

- On the **Format** tab, click **Additional Settings.**

![Image of Region Window For Additional Settings](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/region-window-for-additional-settings.png)

- In the **Customized Format** window, search for **List Separator.**

![Image of Customize Format Window](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/customize-format-window.png)

- Check if the **List Separator** is set to **minus (-)**. Change it to **comma (,)**.

![Image of Apply List Seperator In Customize Format Window](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/apply-list-separator-in-customize-format-window.png)

- Click **OK.**
- Now, open the Excel file and again try to use the formula.

## Case 3: Wrong Text Value

The #Value! error can also occur due to the formula’s wrong value.

For example: If you are using the formula to add values in cells and Excel recognizes the unexpected text value, you may get a #Value error.

![Image of #Value! error in Excel because of Wrong Text Value](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/error-with-wrong-text-value.png)

**Solution**

To fix the issue, you can correct the value or use the SUM function. It is recommended to use functions instead of operations to reduce the errors. In Excel, the formulas with math operators may not able to calculate the text in the cells. The SUM function automatically ignores the text value(er), calculates everything as numbers, and displays the result without the #Value! error.

![Image of Highlighting Arguments Of-Sumfunction to fix #Value! error in Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/highlighting-arguments-of-sumfunction.png)

## Case 4: Blank Space in Cells

You may get the #Value! error if your formula refers to other cells with space or hidden space. Sometimes, spaces that make a cell display blank but actually they are not blank.

![Image of #Value! error in Excel because of Blank Space](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/errormessage-with-blank-space.png)

**Solution**

You can either delete the space or replace the blank space. Here’s how:

#### 1\. Delete the Blank Space

First, check if a cell is blank or not. To do this,

- Select the cell that looks blank.
- Press F2.

![Image of Blank cell Not Showing Space and hence the #Value! error in Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/windows-with-blankcell-not-showing-space.png)

The blank cell won’t show space.

Then, press the Backspace key to delete the space. It will fix the error.

![Image of space removed to fix the #Value! error in Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/result-after-deleting-the-space.png)

#### 2\. Replace Blank Space

You can also use the “Find and Select” option to replace the blank space in Excel. Here are the steps:

- Open the Excel file that shows #Value! error.
- On the **Home** tab, click **Find & Select > Replace**.

![Image of Find And Select Option](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/find-and-select-option-1024x159.png)

- In the **Find what** field, type a single space and delete everything in the “Replace with” field.

![Image of Find And Replace Window](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/find-and-replace-window.png)

![Image of Result After Replacement With Find-And Select Window](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/result-after-replacement-with-find-and-select-window.png)

## Case 4: Problem with Network Connection

Many users have reported experiencing errors when using Excel online due to problems with the network connection.

**Solution**

Check your Internet connection and see if it is working properly.  

## Case 5: Wrong Formula Format

If you enter the wrong formula with a missing parenthesis or comma, then Excel can throw the #Value! error. The error can also occur if the application finds a special character within a cell.

**Solution**

Correct the formula and use the ISTEXT function to find the cells with issues.  

## Case 6: Corruption in the Excel File

If none of the above works, then it indicates the Excel file is corrupt. The formulas in the Excel file do not work due to corruption.

**Solution**

You can [use the Open and Repair utility](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/repair-a-corrupted-workbook-153a45f4-6cab-44b1-93ca-801ddcd4ea53) in Excel if you are getting the error due to corruption in Excel file.

## How to Repair Excel Document on a Flash Drive

**Summary:** Microsoft Excel files are stored on flash drives if they need to be transferred between systems or if they need to be backed up. But sometimes unforeseen issues can corrupt the Excel sheets stored on flash drives. When that happens, it can be an arduous task to repair Excel documents on a flash drive. Through this post let us try to understand the reasons why Excel sheets stored on flash drives can get corrupted and how users can resolve them easily.

[![Free Download for Windows](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/free-download-windows.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/ "Free Download for Windows")

In this digital age, we all work with computers, files, and documents. Flash drives or USBs are common ways of storing data in an external place. Be it for a meeting or for a party playlist, these devices come handy when one wants to transfer data or access the files stored elsewhere.

You may need to access your data from another location. That’s when a USB flash drive might come in handy. And, that’s exactly why Excel sheets too end up on flash drives; either that or for backup purposes. However, there are many instances where an Excel file stored in a USB gets corrupted when one tries to access the file. The error message you get while trying to open the Excel file would be a great clue for figuring out the exact reason behind corruption.

This blog will provide insights into what are the reasons for the corruption of a USB and how the users can repair Excel on flash drive that has been corrupted.

## **Reasons for USB inaccessibility**

Sometimes flash drives or USBs can become unresponsive due to numerous reasons. There are two types of corruption – logical and physical. Physical corruptions occur due to broken stems and connectors, broken circuits, NAND gate, not recognised, RAW, need to format, not accessible, and dead drives (no power supply).

One of the main reasons behind such an error could be that the USB drive has been infected by some virus. This can affect any file – not only the ones which are there in the USB drive but also the ones which are there in the PC/Laptop where you connect the USB drive. It is recommended that you scan the USB drive with reliable antivirus software to detect viruses.

There can be various other reasons that may make your USB corrupt or unresponsive. But there are very slim chances that you will be able to recover a flash drive that has physical damage. However, you can try to run the check disk on the USB drive to fix the drive. We will be discussing this as you read on.

## **Recovery Methods for Corrupted Flash Drives**

There are 3 tried and tested recovery methods. Try them and see which one works out for you.

1. **Restoring Excel Files from Windows backup**

To bring back your old Excel files, fixing up the corrupt file is your best option. Importantly note that this method would work only if your system’s Windows backup option has been enabled.

**Step-by-step process for restoring your older Excel files:**

- Connect your USB drive

## Resolve Compile Error in Hidden Module in Excel: Causes & Solutions

The hidden module in Excel refers to a container with VBA codes, custom queries, and complex macros. The compile error in a hidden (protected) module in the Excel worksheet usually occurs when doing different activities on a macro-enabled sheet, such as merging .xls files. The error can result in macros execution failure. You need to quickly resolve this compile error to restore full functionality of the VBA code. Below, we’ll be discussing the solutions to fix this Excel error. But before that, let’s see why this error occurs.

You may encounter the Compile error in hidden module due to one of the following reasons:

- The code in the workbook is not compatible with the Excel application.
- Manual queries created in a previous version are no longer compatible with your current version of Excel.
- Missing references.
- Invalid .exe files (control information cache files) are automatically created with ActiveX control insertion in Excel file.
- Protected module is corrupted.
- The workbook with hidden module is damaged or corrupted.
- Incompatible add-ins.
- Incompatible Excel file version.
- The module is protected or password-protected.
- Missing or corrupted mscomctl.ocx file.

Excel can throw the compile error while compiling the code that exists in the protected module. So, first check the error and identify the hidden module that is creating the issue. You can unprotect the module. Also, ensure that you have permission to access the VBA code in the module. If the error still exists, follow the below troubleshooting methods.

### Method 1: Re-register ActiveX Control Files or mscomctl.ocx Files

You can get the compile error in the Excel file, containing the VBA code related to ActiveX controls or OCX files. The ActiveX control files and OCX files (mscomctl.ocx files) are the components of Microsoft’s standard controls library. The compile error in the hidden module can occur if these files are missing. In this case, you can use the Regsvr32 tool to re-register the OCX files. The [Regsvr32](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/topic/how-to-use-the-regsvr32-tool-and-troubleshoot-regsvr32-error-messages-a98d960a-7392-e6fe-d90a-3f4e0cb543e5) is a command-line utility to register and unregister OLE controls in the Windows registry.

### Method 2: Delete .exd Files

 The .exd files are temporary files created by Excel when inserting ActiveX controls objects. These temporary files can lead to a compile error if they are corrupted. So, if this issue has occurred, particularly in the Excel file containing ActiveX controls, then deleting .exd files might fix the issue. To delete the .exd file, follow the below steps:

- First, open the **Run** window by pressing the Windows+R keys.

- Click **Browse** to select the problematic workbook.
- The **Open** dialog box will appear. Click on the corrupted file.
- Click the arrow next to the Open button and then select **Open and Repair.**
- You will see a dialog box with three buttons – **Repair, Extract Data,** and **Cancel.**

- Click on the **Repair** button to recover as much of the data as possible.
- After repair, a message is displayed. Click **Close**.

If the [Open and Repair utility fails to work](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/), it indicates the Excel file is severely corrupted.
