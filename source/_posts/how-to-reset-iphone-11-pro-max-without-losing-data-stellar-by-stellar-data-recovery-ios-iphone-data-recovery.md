_“Yesterday, my iPhone stopped working suddenly. I have been trying multiple ways to fix it since then; even tried the force reboot method. Should I simply reset my iPhone? How do I do it without losing my device data?”_

Resetting an iPhone can sometimes become a necessity, whether due to sudden freezing up of your device, software glitches, or slow performance. Often, when your iPhone gets stuck on the Apple logo or suddenly crashes, you can reset your iPhone to fix this minor issue.

A factory reset is also necessary if you want to sell your iPhone and want to start fresh. When resetting your iPhone, it will become an empty slate with no pictures, contacts, videos, downloaded applications, playlists, or anything else. An iPhone reset restores your iPhone to its initial configuration and original factory settings.

However, be careful with this method as resetting your iPhone deletes all files & settings on the device.  For those looking to reset iPhone without losing their precious data, this blog is the answer. Let’s read on to find some simple ways to do so while keeping our data intact.

## **How to reset your iPhone without Losing Data?**

Before starting, it’s crucial to [back up your iPhone data](https://www.stellarinfo.com/article/how-to-back-up-iphone.php) to avoid losing important files and folders. You can back up your iPhone using iCloud, iTunes, or Finder on Mac or PC.

Next, follow the step-by-step instructions on resetting an iPhone using iPhone Settings, iPhone erasure software, and iTunes.

### **Method 1: Reset iPhone Without Losing Data via Settings**

To reset iPhone without losing data, you need to use the **‘Reset’** feature in your iPhone. This feature has different options on how you would like to reset- whether through the **‘Reset All Settings’** or the **‘Reset Network Settings’** option.

The **Reset All Settings** option will remove or reset privacy settings, keyword dictionary, location settings, etc., to default.

## How to Recover deleted pictures on iPhone? 5 Best Solutions

For many iPhone users, photos are the most important data stored on their device – so losing those photos can be a disaster.

However, even if you accidentally deleted some or all of your pictures on iPhone, you can get them back.

We'll discuss how to recover deleted photos on your iPhone with or without backup.

## **How to Recover Deleted Pictures on iPhone?**

There are five best solutions to recover deleted pictures on iPhone. Use the solution that fits your needs and helps you recover your lost pictures.

### 1\. Recover Deleted Pictures on iPhone from Recently Deleted Albums

Pictures taken with the iPhone Camera application are saved by default in the Photos application. If a photo or video is deleted, it's moved to the Recently Deleted folder in the Photos app. This folder is the same as your computer’s Recycle Bin and retains the deleted photos for 30 days. Once this period expires, your photos are permanently deleted from this folder. Perform these steps if you want to recover recently deleted photos on your iPhone:

- Open the **Photos** app.
- Tap on **Albums** at the bottom.

![recover deleted image from recently deleted album-1](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/data-recovery/recover-deleted-pictures-on-iphones/Recover-Deleted-Pictures-from-Recently-Deleted-Album-1.jpg)

- Scroll down to find the **Recently** **Deleted** folder.

- Now, tap **Recover**, and the pictures will be returned to their original iPhone albums.

**Note** – If you want to restore all the deleted photos from your **Recently Deleted** folder, tap on the **Recover All** button.

## **How to Recover Deleted Pictures on iPhone From a Backup?**

If your photos are not in the **Recently Deleted** folder, you might get them back by restoring your iPhone from a previous backup. There are three ways to restore deleted photos on iPhone – iCloud website, iTunes backup, or Finder.

When recovering photos from your iPhone from backup, pay attention to the date of creation of your backups. Use the most recent backup but don't delete all older backups. It's always good to have multiple backups if something goes wrong.

### 2\. Recover Photos on iPhone using iCloud via the iCloud website

**Summary:** Lost your iPhone and now worried about your precious data on it? This post shares how efficiently Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone can recover lost data from a lost or stolen iPhone using iCloud Backup.

_When we lose our phone, then the only thing we worry about is the valuable data stored on it. To recover all our critical data (contacts, messages, photos, videos, voice memo, etc.) all we need to do is restore them either from iTunes or iCloud backup. What if due to some unknown reasons, we are unable to access the backup? Well, in such cases we can still recover our files from the backup via Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone software._

As he had saved the information by backing it up, all he had to do was transfer the information to the new iOS device. However, as luck would have it, he was unable to access the backup files either.

To get rid of the deadlock, he decided to look for a third-party application which can recover iPhone data, and after some analysis, he opted for **[iPhone Data Recovery Software](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/data-recovery-ios/)** by Stellar.
