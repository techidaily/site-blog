Losing contact names and numbers from the device all of a sudden is not new for iPhone users. Sometimes contact names are missing with only the random numbers visible, or the contact list is altogether empty. Mostly, the incidents occur after updating to a newer version of iOS, a bug in the device, accidental deletion, or else formatting of the iPhone.

You can always restore from iCloud or iTunes backup, but sometimes even those attempts might fail to recover deleted contacts. This can be because of wrong user names, passcodes, or device settings.

In such cases, the best way to restore only the missing contacts is to use **iPhone Data Recovery Software** by Stellar**.** Read on to know the four solutions to recover deleted contact on iPhone below.

If you have synced your iPhone to iCloud backup, restore missing contact names and numbers with this method.

- Go to your iPhone **Settings > iCloud > Contacts** (iOS 16 & 15 users follow: Settings > User Name > iCloud)

- Click **Restore Backup**

You can get back the lost or deleted contacts from your iTunes backup.

**_\*\*Important:_ _In the ‘Recently Deleted’ folder, you’ll find photos, video & music files that have been deleted within the last 30 days only.

Things can be complicated as iCloud Photo Library is synced with your different Apple devices which means there could be multiple copies and if a photo, video or music file is deleted from a device, it will not be available on the other devices as well. Deletion sync across all the devices._**
