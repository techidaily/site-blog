## Part 3: How to migrate Android data manually?

By using Dr.Fone Switch or Google Drive, you would be able to perform phone migration in an effortless manner. Nevertheless, if there is no free space on your Drive and you wish to manually migrate Android, then you can also make it work. Following are certain ways to migrate Android to Android using different tools and techniques.

**Contacts, Gmail, Fit Data, Play Store, etc.**

To migrate Android device’s crucial content like its contacts, Google Fit data, Google Play Store data, Music data, etc. you can go to the respective Account and turn on the sync option. Later, you can use the same account and sync these files to the new device.

**Media content**

The smartest way to Android migrate to new phone your media files (like photos, videos, music, etc.) is by syncing them with Google Drive. If your Drive has limited free space, then you need to manually transfer this data. Connect your device to your system and open its storage. From here, you can manually copy the files having your media content and paste them to a safe location (or directly to the new device’s storage).
