## How to Recover deleted pictures on iPhone? 5 Best Solutions

For many iPhone users, photos are the most important data stored on their device – so losing those photos can be a disaster.

However, even if you accidentally deleted some or all of your pictures on iPhone, you can get them back.

We'll discuss how to recover deleted photos on your iPhone with or without backup.

## **How to Recover Deleted Pictures on iPhone?**

There are five best solutions to recover deleted pictures on iPhone. Use the solution that fits your needs and helps you recover your lost pictures.

### 1\. Recover Deleted Pictures on iPhone from Recently Deleted Albums

Pictures taken with the iPhone Camera application are saved by default in the Photos application. If a photo or video is deleted, it's moved to the Recently Deleted folder in the Photos app. This folder is the same as your computer’s Recycle Bin and retains the deleted photos for 30 days. Once this period expires, your photos are permanently deleted from this folder. Perform these steps if you want to recover recently deleted photos on your iPhone:

- Open the **Photos** app.
- Tap on **Albums** at the bottom.

**Note** – If you want to restore all the deleted photos from your **Recently Deleted** folder, tap on the **Recover All** button.

## **How to Recover Deleted Pictures on iPhone From a Backup?**

If your photos are not in the **Recently Deleted** folder, you might get them back by restoring your iPhone from a previous backup. There are three ways to restore deleted photos on iPhone – iCloud website, iTunes backup, or Finder.

When recovering photos from your iPhone from backup, pay attention to the date of creation of your backups. Use the most recent backup but don't delete all older backups. It's always good to have multiple backups if something goes wrong.

### 2\. Recover Photos on iPhone using iCloud via the iCloud website

Apple's iCloud Backup helps you recover deleted photos from your iPhone to your system. For iCloud to automatically back up all your pictures and videos, you must first set up and enable iCloud Photos on your device. Here's how to enable iCloud Photos to Backup all your photos:

## Factors to Consider While Choosing a Deleted iPhone Texts Recovery Software

Before looking at the list of the best iPhone data recovery software to recover deleted text messages, let’s take a look at various factors that one should keep in mind while choosing the right data recovery software.

![factors to consider when looking for an iPhone text recovery software](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-8b4e845/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/iPhone-Recovery-Software-1024x576.jpg)

- **Reliability** –It is best to choose an iPhone data recovery software from a reliable brand as they have the expertise to back their claim.
- **Features** – Various iPhone recovery software can recover various types of deleted data like photos, videos, messages, etc. They can also be used to perform deleted SMS recovery for recovering deleted text messages. As iPhone data is precious and important, selecting a brand that could help us recover deleted iPhone data from other sources like external storage media is wise.
- **User Reviews** – User reviews help new users and potential buyers in making their choice. Reviews are also helpful as they add to the legitimacy of software and its claims. Therefore, one should always read the reviews and select the right iPhone data recovery software.
- **Data Recovery Performance** – This is an important factor that everyone should consider before choosing the right iPhone data recovery software. Great performance always makes the software stand out from the rest. Key factors to look for are speed of data recovery, available modes of data recovery, supported file types, etc. A user should check these before choosing a data recovery software.

A simple UI enhances your user experience and enables you to use the software with ease. Hence, this is also an important factor to consider.
- **Pricing** – While most of the ‘free’ iPhone data recovery software claims to offer the best experience, the best deals offering value for the money spent are usually found amidst the list of paid software. This software not only helps the user recover deleted iPhone texts but also provides an interface to save the recovered data safely and securely post-data recovery.
