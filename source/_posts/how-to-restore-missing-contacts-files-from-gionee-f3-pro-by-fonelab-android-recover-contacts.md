    Interaction between cell phone and human being becomes much easier since the introduction of touch-based smartphones. Although touch phones bring many benefits to the end user, there are some painful side effects made us miserable, like accident deletions. A single swipe or tap may get an item being deleted. So it's very possible to delete something totally by accident. And you just can't stop it from happening as it's just too common among different users.

    <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/aiseesoft-android-data-recovery/" ><strong>Android Data Recovery</strong></a> is a powerful data recovery solution I came across recently. I have tried several recovery tools in last week and Android Data Recovery is the best among them for its recovery ability and simple user interface. Only 3 steps are involved in the whole recovery process to get back lost or deleted contacts, text messages, photos, media files and documents. You trigged the recover button, and then handle it over to the software. Grab a cup of coffee, then your lost contacts of Gionee F3 Pro will come back after your return.
