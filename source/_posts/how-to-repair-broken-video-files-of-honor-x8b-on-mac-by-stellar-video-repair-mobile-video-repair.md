"Hi! My Honor X8b phone captured a MP4 video clip but neither it nor other players can play it back correctly. The audio is ok but the video is in green and black and seems like five pictures tiled. How could I possibly repair the corrupted MP4 file? The video clip is very important and memorable for me. Thanks."
