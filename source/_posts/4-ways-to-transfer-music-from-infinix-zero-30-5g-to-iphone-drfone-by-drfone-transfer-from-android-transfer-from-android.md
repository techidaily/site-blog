1. Install and open the Dr.Fone toolkit on your computer and click on the “Phone Manager” option from the home screen.

In this way, you can selectively transfer music from Infinix Zero 30 5G to iPhone in a hassle-free manner.

## Part 3: How to transfer music from Infinix Zero 30 5G to iPhone using Android File Transfer?

If you use a Mac, then you can use Android File Transfer to move your data from your Infinix Zero 30 5G to your system.
