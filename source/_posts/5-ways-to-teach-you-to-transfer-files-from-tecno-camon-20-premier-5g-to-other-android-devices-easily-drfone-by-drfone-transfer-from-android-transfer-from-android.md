5. Once the process is complete, click **Next** \> **Done**.

Before you start the file transfer process using a Quick Switch, you should ensure both devices are fully charged. Furthermore, you should also update your Samsung device to the latest software version to avoid potential transfer issues, such as data corruption or incomplete transfers.

## Transfer Data From Samsung to Pixel Using Google Drive

Being an Android user requires a Google account, granting you access to 15 GB of free storage space on Google Drive, making the app an excellent way to transfer files from your old phone to your new one. Here’s how you can use it:

1. Using your old Samsung phone, navigate to **Settings**\> **Accounts and Backup**\> **Back up data** under **Google Drive**.

2. Change the **Backup details**and add the types of data you want to back up.
3. Hit the **Back up now**button and give your phone time to upload everything to Google Drive. You can watch the progress at the top of your screen.
4. Power on your new Pixel 8/8 Pro device and follow the on-screen setup instructions.
5. Log in with the same Google account you used on the Samsung phone.
6. The new device will immediately recognize older backups.

7. Choose the latest backup made on your Samsung phone and tap **Restore**to copy data from Samsung to Pixel.

It’s worth noting that Google Drive users aren’t limited to 15 GB of storage space, as paid plans also include 100 GB and 200 GB options for a few dollars per month, making this type of transfer incredibly efficient.

## Transfer Data From Samsung to Google Pixel 8, 8 Pro Using Email

Although it’s not as effective as the abovementioned methods, email is also an option for transferring data between phones. Using it is as straightforward as sending emails, meaning that this method is effortless, and anyone can do it. Here’s how:

1. Open your old Samsung phone’s email app and compose a new email.
2. Hit the attachment icon and add your files to the email. Send it to whomever you like or to your secondary email account.

    ![transfer data via email attachments](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/copy-data-from-samsung-to-pixel-18.jpg)

3. Launch the email app on your new Google Pixel 8 or 8 Pro device.
4. Download the email attachments you’ve just sent.

Please note that while email providers like Gmail, Yahoo, or Hotmail might not have restrictions on the number of files you can send, they do restrict emails to 25MB in size. It essentially means that this method will work for smaller files but isn’t viable if you need to transfer large sets of data.
