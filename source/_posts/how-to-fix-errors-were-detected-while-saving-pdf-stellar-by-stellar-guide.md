Microsoft Office applications are used by millions of people across the world on a daily basis. While knowing how to smartly work with Office tools like Excel, Word, and PowerPoint is something most users are aware of, dealing with issues like corruption in MS Office files is a totally different ball game. In this article, that’s what we’re focusing on.

## MS Office and Associated Problems

Creating a detailed travel plan, making a list of your monthly work assignments, calculating the total of hundreds of petty transactions, or designing a presentation for work, if you’ve ever done any of those using your computer, you’ve probably worked with MS Office. Word, Excel and PowerPoint have become household names thanks to their utility and ease-of-use. Technically sound as well as everyday home users know how to work with Office applications. The suite is reliable, easy to work around, and customizable.

![word excel and powerpoint](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-excel-and-powerpoint.jpg)

_Now keep the good part aside for a few seconds and consider what happens if the files you create using Word / Excel / PowerPoint get damaged. It has happened to all of us. One day we save an Excel sheet after putting in hours of work only to discover that all of the data is appearing gibberish the next day. All that we’re left with is the thought – how did that happen?!_

The **reason behind** such a catastrophe is file corruption, and if you’re thinking why your Office files got corrupted while the system appears to be running just fine, here are a few questions that might aid your understanding:

1. Did your computer shut down abruptly due to a power surge while you were working with Office files?
2. Did you accidentally save a new file with the same name as another one without double-checking?
3. Did your Word / Excel / PowerPoint application throw some unexpected errors a few days before you faced the file corruption?
4. Have other files on the system become missing or damaged too?
5. Was the file that got corrupted overloaded with data?

If the answer to most of those questions was a ‘**Yes**’, no wonder your Office files got corrupted. In this case, the only way to regain access to all your data is to repair the file.

## How to Repair Office Documents (Word, Excel and PowerPoint)

Use one of the below-mentioned methods:

### <u>Open and Repair Functionality</u>

Repairing MS Office documents is a surprisingly easy task, and it is made possible through an inbuilt “**Open and Repair**” utility. Here’s how you can use this utility to repair corrupt PowerPoint files, Word files, and Excel files.

1. Launch the application whose document you are trying to repair.
    - To repair corrupt Word files (.doc / .docx), launch MS Word
    - To repair corrupt Excel files (.xls / .xlsx), launch MS Excel
    - To repair corrupt PowerPoint files (.ppt / .pptx), launch MS PowerPoint

2. From the **File** menu, click on the **Open** This should display the ‘Open File’ dialog box (in more recent versions of MS Office, you should click on the **Office** button and then the **Open** button).
3. Select the corrupt file to be repair by single-clicking on it. Then at the bottom-right corner of the dialog box, you’ll find a drop-down sign adjacent to the Open button.
4. Click on the drop-down sign to display advanced options which will include **[Open and Repair](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/ms-excel-open-and-repair-option-is-not-working/)**.
5. Select this option and follow the subsequent instructions to repair the corrupted files.

![Open and Repair](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Open-and-Repair.png)

### <u>Repair MS Office Installation</u>

If the above mentioned technique doesn’t work, there might be an issue with the system and registry files associated with MS Office. To repair MS Office installation:

1. Go to your computer’s **Control Panel**
2. Here, select **Uninstall a program** and from the list of all installed programs, select **Microsoft Office**
3. Now click on **Change** and from the dialog that opens, select **Repair**
4. Click on **Continue** to initiate the repair. When it completes the wizard will prompt you to restart your computer. Click on **Yes**

![Repair MS Office](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Repair-MS-Office.png)

### <u>Remove Add-ins from Office Applications</u>

We often install add-ins to augment the functionality of our existing applications, but faulty or bugged add-ins can prove to be a pain. Office file corruption is one of the side-effects of messed up add-ins. Thus, removing them could be a solution to the issue.

1. Launch the particular Office program in safe mode. This will disable the working of all add-ins
2. Open the file in question and check its data. If it appears fine, a faulty add-in is where the real problem lies
3. One by one start enabling add-ins and reopening the file till you spot the bad one

![MS Office Add-ins](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/add-ins.jpg)
