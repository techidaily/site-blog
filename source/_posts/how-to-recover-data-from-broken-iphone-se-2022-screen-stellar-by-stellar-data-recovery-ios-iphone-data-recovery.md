## How to Recover Data from Broken iPhone Screen

**Summary:** Struggling to recover data after your iPhone’s screen broke? Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone can help restore data efficiently from an iPhone with a broken screen.

Your iPhone is the most cherished personal gadget as it has become more innovative and influential due to its many valuable features. Moreover, information such as notes, contacts, iMessage, calendar entries, text messages, WhatsApp/Kik messages, pictures, and videos are readily available, making it even more lovable. This is why we need to know how to recover data from broken iPhone screens.

These days, though there are plenty of best ways to back up your data, users often overlook the importance of Backup. It happened with _Jacky Jainco; w_hile taking a DSLR-like photo on his iPhone 14 Pro Max, he accidentally dropped his iPhone and, consequently, broke it.

The real problem was not the broken iPhone but to recover data from iPhone as it was not synced with iTunes and iCloud Backup. As a result, he couldn’t access his files, more importantly, his pictures.

You might have dropped your iPhone several times, and luckily, the excellent cover has saved it on all occasions. However, any drop could cause potential damage putting your data at stake; therefore, leverage iTunes or iCloud backup to recover data from the [damaged iPhone](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/how-to-fix-retrieve-pictures-videos-from-water-damaged-iphone/) screen.

## **Bringing Back Your Data From Backup**

You can restore your files from either iTunes or iCloud Backup. In addition, replacement screens are available; you can have an appointment with the genius bar, get your damaged iPhone fixed, and then recover your data. Also, when backup files are inaccessible, turn to an iPhone data recovery software for an easy solution.

Sorting backup files is unmanageable as they tend to be large, running into GBs. Moreover, the process can be tedious, especially when you have to sort all files, even when you need to recover only a specific file. So it is when [iPhone Data Recovery Software](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/data-recovery-ios/) by Stellar is fruitful. The software lets you recover deleted files from encrypted iTunes backup files or recover data from an iPhone that would not turn on. Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone supports broken iPhone data recovery from series of iPhone 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, XR, XS, X, 8 Plus, 8, 7 Plus, 7, 6S Plus, 6S, 6 Plus, 6, 5S, 5C, 5, 4S, and 4.

_You can recover a specific file without the pain of going through all backup files as the software lists all the files in an organized structure, thus, saving your precious time and effort._

### **4\. Contact Apple**

Apple may record and store information, such as to whom you had called and your iPhone/ iPad network configurations. It stores this information for up to 30 days. You don’t get the details like the content of the conversation or whether your call was answered or not.

Nevertheless, you can contact Apple requesting for FaceTime call logs by clicking on this link and submitting the request – [Read More](https://www.apple.com/privacy/contact/)

Apple will get back to you.

## **Conclusion**

iCloud and iTunes backup are the natural way for Apple users to recover FaceTime deleted call history. However, Apple’s solution though workable is not efficient when it comes to the recovery of specific types of data. The iTunes or iCloud backup recovery methods replace every existing data on your iPhone with an old/recent backup. You lose your current photos, videos, call history, messages, chats, etc.

Whereas [Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/data-recovery-ios/) tackles this recovery issue more effectively. It recovers lost FaceTime calls and also keeps your current data intact on the iPhone.

It is available for both Windows and macOS computers.
