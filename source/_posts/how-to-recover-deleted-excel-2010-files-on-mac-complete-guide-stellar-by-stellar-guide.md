**_Note_**_: If these options are already selected, then unselect and re-select them._

### **Method 2: Enable Sharing Wizard Option**

The error “Your changes could not be saved to file because of a sharing violation” can also occur if the sharing wizard option is disabled on your system. You can check and enable the sharing wizard option using these steps:

- Go to your system’s **Documents** folder.
- Click **View > Options > Change folders** **and search options.**

![Click View Option In Documents](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/click-view-option-in-documents.jpg)

- In the **Add new location** window, select **Browse** to locate and choose the folder, and then click **OK**.

### **Method 4: Open Excel in Safe Mode**

![Type Safe Mode Command In Excel](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/type-safe-mode-command-in-excel.jpg)

## [Fix] Excel formula not showing result

**Summary:** Is your Excel spreadsheet showing text of a formula you’ve entered and not its result? This blog explains the possible reasons behind such an issue. Also, it describes solutions to fix the ‘Excel formula not showing result’ error. You can try Stellar Repair for Excel software to recover engineering and shared formulas.

[![Free Download for Windows](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/free-download-windows.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/ "Free Download for Windows")

Sometimes, when you type a formula in a cell of worksheet and press Enter, instead of showing the calculated result, it returns the formula as text. For instance, Excel cell shows:

![Excel not Showing Formula](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Excel-not-showing-formula-1.jpg)

But you should get the result as:

![Excel Formula Working Sample](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Excel-not-showing-formula-2.jpg)

## **Why Does Excel Show or Display the Formula Not the Result?**

**Following are the possible reasons that may lead to the ‘Excel showing formula not result’ issue:**

1. You accidentally enabled “**Show Formulas**” in Excel.
2. The cell format in a spreadsheet is set to text.
3. ‘Automatic calculation’ feature in Excel is set to manual.
4. Excel thinks your formula is text (Syntax are not followed).
5. You type numbers in a cell with unnecessary formatting.

## **How to Fix ‘Excel Showing Formula Not Result’ Issue?**

### **Solution 1 – Disable Show Formulas**

If only the formula shows in Excel not result, check if you have accidentally or intentionally enabled ‘show formula’ feature of Excel. Instead of applying calculations and then showing results, this feature displays the actual text written by you.

You can use the ‘Show Formulas’ feature to quickly view all formulas, but if you are not aware of this feature, and enabled it accidentally, it can be a headache. To disable this mode, go to ‘**Formulas**’ and click on ‘**Show formula enabled**.’ If it’s previously enabled, it will be disabled by just clicking on it.

![Show Formula Enabled](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/show-formulas-1.jpg)

### **Solution 2 – Cell Format Set to Text**

Another possible reason that only formula shows in Excel not result could be that the cell format is set to text. This means that anything written in any format in that cell will be treated as regular text. If so, change the format to General or any other. To get Excel to recognize the change in the format, you may need to enter cell edit mode by clicking into the formula bar or just press F2.

![Enter Cell Edit Mode by Clicking into the Formula Bar](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/formula-f2.jpg)

### **Solution 3 – Change Calculation Options from ‘Manual’ to ‘Automatic’**

There is an “automatic calculation” feature in Excel, which tells Excel to do calculations automatically or manually. If ‘Excel formula is not showing results’, it may be because the automatic calculations feature is set to manual. This issue is not easily detected because it results in calculating formula in one cell but if you copy it to some other cell, it will retain the first calculation and will not recalculate on the base of the new location. To fix this, follow these steps:

- In Excel, click on the ‘**File**’ tab on the top left corner of the screen.
- In the window that opens, click on ‘**Options**’ from the left menu bar.
- From ‘Excel Options’ dialog box, select ‘**Formulas**’ from the left side menu and then change the ‘**Calculation options**’ to ‘**Automatic**’ if it’s currently set as ‘Manual’.

![Automatic Calculations Feature](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/calculation-options.jpg)

- Click on ‘**OK**’. This will redirect you to your sheet.

### **Solution 4 – Type Formula in the Right Format**

There is a proper way to tell Excel that your text is a formula. If you don’t write the formula in a particular format, Excel considers it as simple text and hence no calculations are performed according to it. For this reason, keep the following in mind when typing a formula:

- **Equal sign:** Every formula in Excel should start with an equal sign (=). If you miss it, Excel will mistake your formula as regular text.

- **Space before equal sign:** You are not supposed to enter any space before equal sign. Maybe a single space will be hard for us to detect, but it breaks the rule of writing formulas for Excel.

- **Formula wrapped in quotes:** You need to make sure that your formula is not wrapped in quotes. People usually make this mistake of writing a formula in quotes, but in Excel, quotes are used to signify text. So your formula won’t be evaluated. But you can add quotes inside formula if required, for example: =SUMIFS(F5:F9,G5:G9,”>30″).

- **Match all parentheses in a formula:** Arguments of Excel functions are entered in parenthesis. In complex cases, you may need to enter more sets of parenthesis. If those parentheses are not paired/closed properly, Excel may not be able to evaluate the entered formula.

- **Nesting limit:** If you are nesting two or more Excel functions into each other, for example using nested IF loop, remember the following rules:
  - Excel 2019, 2016, 2013, 2010, and 2007 versions only allow to use up to 64 nested functions.
  - Excel 2003 and lower versions only allow up to 7 nested functions.

### **Solution 5 – Enter Numbers without any Formatting**

When you use a number in the formula, make sure you don’t enter any decimal separator or currency sign, e.g. $, etc. In an Excel formula, a comma is used to separate arguments of a function and a dollar sign makes an absolute cell reference. Most of these special characters have built-in functions so avoid using them unnecessarily.

## **What to Do If the Manual Solutions Don’t Work?**

If you’ve tried out the manual solutions mentioned above but still unable to resolve the ‘Excel formula not showing result’ issue, you can try repairing your Excel file with the help of an automated [Excel repair software](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/), such as **Stellar Repair for Excel**.

## How to Repair Corrupt Pivot Table of MS Excel File?

**Summary:** If you are not able to perform any action on the Pivot Table of MS Excel file, it indicates Excel Pivot Table corruption. In such a case, you must repair the corrupt Pivot Table of MS Excel file by using an Excel repair software or manual troubleshooting steps discussed in this post.

[![Free Download for Windows](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/free-download-windows.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/ "Free Download for Windows")

MS Excel is equipped with several brilliant features and functions which make working with large volumes of data easy. In addition to helping users save data into well-organized cells and tables, the application helps users draw inferences from the data. Pivot Table is one such Excel feature that helps users extract the gist from a large number of rowed data. But often, the Pivot table may get corrupted and lead to unexpected errors or data loss.

**Corrupt Pivot Tables** can stop users from reopening previously saved Excel workbooks, raising the serious issue of data inaccessibility. Resolving such issues is an uphill task unless one gets to the actual root cause of the problem.

_However, with Stellar Repair for Excel software, you can **repair the corrupt Pivot table of MS Excel file** while keeping the Excel file data, formatting, layout, etc. intact._

![Repair Corrupt Pivot Table of MS Excel File](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1-2.jpg)

## **Excel Pivot Tables & Associated Problems**

Pivot Tables in Microsoft Excel are created by applying an operation such as sorting, averaging, or summing to the data in certain tables. The results of the operation are saved as summarized data in other tables. Typically, working on the grouping of saved data, Pivot Tables are used in data processing and are found in data visualization programs, such as spreadsheets or business intelligence software.

Put simply, Pivot Tables in Excel allow you to extract the significance or the gist from a large, detailed data set by allowing you to slice-and-dice data, sort-and-filter data, or arrange it in any way you want.

## Frequently Encountered Problems with Pivot Tables in MS Excel

Take a look at the most frequently encountered **Pivot Table issues**:

- You add **new data into a pivot table** but it doesn’t show up when you refresh
- **Pivot Table contains Blanks** instead of Zeros for fields that have no source data
- **Automatic field names assigned** by the Pivot Table can be inappropriate
- It doesn’t directly **show the percentage of total**
- **Grouping** one pivot table affects another
- Your **number of formatting gets lost**
- Refreshing a pivot table **messes up column widths**
- Field headings make no sense and **add clutter**

While some of the above problems seem minute and can easily be resolved using a few tweaks, bigger issues like unexpected Pivot Table error messages that an Excel throws can be troublesome.

## **Pivot Table Errors & Their Reasons**

Excel users who have built new Pivot Tables in Excel often report the following errors when trying to reopen a previously saved workbook:

_**We found a problem with some content in <filename>. Do you want us to try to recover as much as we can? If you trust the source of this workbook, click Yes.**_

![Pivot Table Corruption error in Excel File](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1-3.png)

Naturally, users are prompted to click on ‘**Yes**’. But when they do, they get another error message saying:

_**Removed Part: /xl/pivotCache/pivotCacheDefinition1.xml part with XML error**_

_**(PivotTable cache) Load error. Line 2, column 0**_

_**Removed Feature: PivotTable report from /xl/pivotTables/pivotTable1.xml part (PivotTable view)**_

Such errors are indicative of the fact that the **data within the Pivot Table still exists**, but the table itself isn’t functioning anymore.

There could be two primary reasons behind such behavior:

- You’ve **created the Pivot Table in an older version** of Excel but are trying to open-refresh-save it through a newer Excel version
- The **Pivot Table itself is corrupted**

## **How to Repair the Pivot Table Quickly?**

To solve the errors associated with Pivot Tables, you need to repair them. But Microsoft doesn’t offer any inbuilt technique or option to repair Pivot Tables. Thus, to fix the issue, you either need some sort of workaround or an [Excel file repair software](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/).

## **Methods to Fix Corrupt Pivot Table in MS Excel**

If you can, save all its contents to a new Pivot Table in the latest version of Excel so that this problem doesn’t arise anymore.

### **Method 2: Use Pivot Table Options**

If, however, above method doesn’t work, follow the below-mentioned steps:

- Right-click on the **Pivot Table** and click on **Pivot Table Options**
- On the Display tab, clear the checkbox labeled “**Show Properties in ToolTips**”
