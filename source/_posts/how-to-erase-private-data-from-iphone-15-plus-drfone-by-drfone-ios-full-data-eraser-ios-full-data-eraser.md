Device data is ceremonially essential, leading to the need for protection from any unauthorized access. While selling out an iPhone, erasing data from the iPhone 15 Plus device is considered the most crucial clause. Although people consider manually erasing the device's data, it is not optimal. Thus, the need for a data eraser is appropriate. This guide comes with a comprehensive overview of how to use [Dr.Fone - Data Eraser (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/ios-data-eraser/) to erase iOS data entirely.
