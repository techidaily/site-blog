[![Free Download for Windows](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/free-download-windows.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/ "Free Download for Windows")

You may experience the “Microsoft Excel cannot access the file” error when saving the Excel file. This happens when the Excel application fails to read the file you are attempting to save. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the file name or its path. Sometimes, the error occurs if the file you are trying to access is already in use by another application. Some other reasons for the “Excel cannot access the file” error are:

- Faulty or incompatible Excel add-ins.
- The file is in Protected View.
- The Excel file is damaged or corrupted.
- You do not have the required permissions to access the file.
- The Excel file is not in a compatible format.

## **Methods to Fix “Microsoft Excel Cannot Access the File” Error**

Sometimes, changing the file location can fix the “Microsoft Excel cannot access the file” error. You can try changing the file location, if the location is incorrect. If moving the file to a different location didn’t work, then try the below troubleshooting methods.

### **Method 1: Check the File Name and Path**

You can get the “Microsoft Excel cannot access file” error if there is an issue with the file path – either the path does not exist or it is too lengthy, thus creating conflicts. Make sure the file path is correct. If the file name is too long, you can rename the file with a short name and also move the file to the parent folder instead of a subfolder. After that, remove the file from the **Recent** list that is created by Excel based on your recent activity. Follow the below steps:

- Open the Excel application.
- In the **Recent list**, right-click on the affected Excel file.
- Now, select **Remove from list**.

![Selecting the "remove from list" option](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/click-remove-from-list.jpg)

- Close the Excel application.

Now, reopen the problematic file and check if the error exists. If yes, then follow the next solution.

### **Method 2: Try Clearing the Microsoft Office Cache**

Sometimes, clearing the Microsoft Office cache can help eliminate the “Excel cannot access the file” error. To clear the Microsoft Office cache, follow the given steps:

- First, close all the Office applications.
- Press **Windows+R** to open the **Run** window.
- Type %localappdata%\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\OfficeFileCache and press the **Enter** key. You can change ‘16.0’ with your Office version.

- In the **OfficeFileCache** window, clear all the temporary files.

### **Method 3: Check and Update Microsoft Excel**

You can try updating your Microsoft Excel application. The latest updates include bug fixes, security patches, and other improvements. Updating the application can help fix several issues that might be causing the error. Here are the steps to update Microsoft Excel:

- Open your Excel application.
- Go to **File** and then select **Account.**
- Under **Product information**, click **Update Options** and then click **Update Now**.

### **Method 4: Disable Protected View**

You may get the “Microsoft Excel cannot access the file” error if the [Protected View](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/office/what-is-protected-view-d6f09ac7-e6b9-4495-8e43-2bbcdbcb6653) option is enabled. You can try disabling the Protected View settings in Excel. This allows you to open the file without any restrictions. However, disabling the protected view can put your system at high risk. To disable the Protected View in Microsoft Excel, follow the below steps:

- In Excel, go to **File** and then click **Options**.
- In the **Excel Options** window, click **Trust Center** and then click **Trust Center Settings.**

![Go To Trust Center and Click on Trust Center Settings ](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/go-to-trust-center-and-click-trust-center-settings-1.jpg)

- Click **Protected View** from the left pane in the **Trust Center Settings** window.
- Unselect the options under **Protected View**. Click **OK.**

### **Method 5: Check and Disable Add-ins**

The “Excel cannot access the file” error can also occur due to faulty add-ins in Excel. To check if the error has occurred due to some faulty add-ins, open the application in **safe mode** (press Windows + R and typeexcel /safe in the Run window**)**. If you can save the file without any hiccups in safe mode, this indicates some problematic add-ins are behind the error. You can remove the Excel add-ins by following these steps:

- Open your Excel application and go to **File > Options.**

- In **Excel Options**, select **Trust Center** and then click **Trust Center Settings**.
- In Trust Center Settings, click **Add-ins** and thenselect “**Disable all applications Add-ins”.** Click **OK.**

![Go to 'Add ins' and select disable all application add ins](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/click-add-ins-and-select-disable-all-application-add-ins.jpg)

### **Method 6: Check File Permission**

You can get the “Excel cannot access the file” error if you don’t have sufficient permissions to modify the Excel file. You can check and provide the write permissions to fix the issue. Here’s how to do so:

- Open Windows Explorer.
- Find the affected Excel file, right-click on it, and click **Properties**.  

![Click Properties Option](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/click-properties-option.jpg)

- In the **Security** window, select the **user names** under **‘Group or users name’**.
- Check the file permissions and make sure the write option is enabled. If not, then grant the permission. Click **Apply** and then **OK.**

### **Method 7: Check External Links**

The “Excel cannot access the file” error can also occur due to broken external links in the Excel file. External links are references to the data or content in other files. The link usually breaks if the file has been moved to another location or the file name is changed. You can check and [change the source of link.](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/fix-broken-links-to-data-84f494f9-1da9-460a-aa83-aba07108bc97)

## Workarounds to Resolve the 'Excel found unreadable content in filename.xls' Error

There is no permanent solution to fix the 'Excel found unreadable content' error. But, following are some workarounds you can try to resolve the error.

**_Note:_** _Before you try any of these workarounds, run Excel with administrator privileges and try opening the Excel file that is throwing the 'unreadable content' error. If this doesn't fix the error, proceed with the workarounds below._

### **Workaround 1 – Try Opening the File in Excel 2003**

Sometimes a problem in the current Excel version might prevent a file from opening. To resolve this error, try opening the problematic file in Excel 2003. If the file opens, save the data in a web page file format (.html) and then try opening the .html file in MS Excel 2010/2007. The detailed step-wise instructions are as follows:

- Open the .xls file in Excel 2003.
- When the file opens, click on File > Save.
- In the 'Save As' dialog box, choose Web Page (.html) as the 'Save as type' and then click 'Save.' Doing so will save everything from your .xls file, opened with 2003, in .html file format.
- Open the .html file in Excel 2010/2007. And then, save the file with .xlsx extension with a new name to avoid overwriting the original file.

Now, open the Excel 2010/2007 file and check if the error is fixed. If not, use the next workaround.

### **Workaround 2 – Make the Excel File 'Read-only'**

Try to open your '.xlsx' file by making it 'read-only'. Follow these steps:

- In Excel, click 'File' from the main menu.
- Select 'Save' for a new document or 'Save As' for a previously saved document in the screen that appears.

![Excel File Saving Options](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Excel-file-saving-options-image-3.png)

- From the 'Save As' dialog box, click Tools > General Options.

![Open General Options In Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Open-general-options-in-excel-image-4.png)

- Click on the 'Read-only recommended' checkbox to make the document read-only and then click 'OK'.

![Select Read Only Recommended Option](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Select-read-only-recommended-option-image-5.png)

Now open a new '.xlsx' file and copy everything from the corrupt Excel file to this new file. Finally, save this file and try to open it again.

### **Workaround 3 – Move Excel File to a New Folder**

Some users have reported that they could open their Excel file, following the 'Excel unreadable content' error, by simply moving the file to a different folder and saving it under a new name. You can also move the affected file to a new folder and try opening it. If this didn't help resolve the error, follow the next workaround.

### **Workaround 4 – Install Visual Basic Component**

At times, it is seen that installing the 'Visual Basic' component of MS Office 2010 resolves the 'Excel found unreadable content 2010' error. To do so, follow these steps:

- Navigate to Control Panel > Programs and select Microsoft Office 2010.
- Click 'Change' and then select 'Add or Remove Programs'.
- Next, click the 'plus' sign provided next to Office Shared Features.
- Click 'Visual Basic for Applications'. After that, right-click and choose 'Run from My Computer' and hit the 'Continue' button.

## Repair Office 2016 Files (Word, Excel and PowerPoint)on Windows

If you frequently work with Microsoft Word (.docx), Excel (.xlsx), and PowerPoint (.pptx) files, then issues like file inaccessibility or corruption won’t be new to you.

Let’s discuss some common scenarios which may lead to corrupt MS Office 2016 files:  

## Scenarios behind Microsoft Office Files Corruption

### Scenario 1 – Disruption during Data Migration

You decide to move Office files from your hard drive to other removable media. However, when you try to access the data within the files post-migration, you may find Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files showing gibberish characters. Due to a power surge, sudden system shutdown, and internal mechanical failure, the files may have turned corrupt.

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/article/word/Word-displaying-gibberish-characters.png)

Figure 1- Microsoft Word file showing garbage characters

### Scenario 2 – Office Files and Registry Entries Become Infected

When you open or use the Microsoft Office application, it crashes as soon as it opens. You assume that an add-in was causing the problem and restart the Office application without add-ins loaded, but the application still crashes. This may happen because of a virus infecting the Office files and registry values, thus leading to corrupt or damaged Office files.

### **Scenario 3 – Inaccessible or Lost Data**

Suppose all your Office files are stored on a USB device, and you unplugged the device while it was still open in Windows. Now, when you attempt to open a Word or an Excel file, all the data is gone. Unsafe removal of USB or any other external storage device may corrupt the data inside your Office files or turn the file inaccessible.

## How Can You Deal with Microsoft Office Files Corruption?

Here are a few solutions that can help you fix or repair Office 2016 Files Corruption:

### Solution 1 – Use Microsoft in-built Repair Utility

Microsoft recommends using its in-built repair utility, 'Open and Repair', to fix corrupt Office files. Follow these steps to understand how you can use the utility to repair the corrupt Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files:

1. To repair corrupt Word (.doc, .docx) files, launch MS Word
2. To repair corrupt Excel files (.xls, .xlsx) files, launch MS Excel
3. To repair corrupt PowerPoint (.ppt, .pptx) files, launch MS PowerPoint

- Click File, and then click the Open tab.
- Click Navigate to the location or folder where the Word, Excel, or PowerPoint file is stored.
- Select the corrupt file you want to repair by single-clicking on it, and then find the Open button and click on the drop-down menu next to it.

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/article/word/Open-and-repair.png)

- From the drop-down menu, click the **Open and Repair** option and follow the subsequent instructions to repair Office 2016 files.

### **Solution 2 – Repair Office 2016 Installation**

- Open your PC's control panel
- Click **Programs**

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/article/word/ControlPanel-Programs.png)

- Under **Change your installation of Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2016,** choose Repair, and then click **Continue** to initiate the repair process.

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/article/word/Repair-Office-Application.jpg)

Undoubtedly, Excel is so powerful that it can help you to process, analysis, and store data, in masses.

That’s the reason it has been there for years and helping this world in data.

But…

With all those powers comes some nasty problems which no Excel users like to face. Can you guess what I’m talking about?

Think about a Corrupted Excel File. Nightmare? Isn’t it?

And do you remember that last time when you have opened a workbook and you got a message that this workbook is might corrupt?

The TRUTH is, this is something which you cannot avoid, but, you can [prepare yourself in the best way](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/) and deal with it like a PRO.

So today, in this post, I’d like to share with you to everything you need to know about a corrupt Excel file (.xls), why it happens, how to fix it like a PRO, and much more.

...let’s get started.

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/Mac-Regional/introduction.jpg)

**Note**: In this post, we’ll be covering the .xls version (which is the extension for the file which is created in Excel 2007 or the earlier versions) and if you want to know about the new version, [here’s the quick fix](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/) for that.

## Why My Excel File Got Corrupted?

There can be one or multiple reasons for an Excel file to get corrupted. Below I have detailed about some of the major of them.

### 1\. Large Excel File

You can store data in a workbook the way you want but sometimes using excessive thing can make an Excel file bigger in size.

And that kind of data files can crash at any point in time. Here are a few things which make the Excel files heavy, like

- Conditional Formatting.
- Colors formatting.
- Using merged cells in place of text alignment.
- Volatile functions: Formulae that iterate every time you open or change a cell value; OFFSET, NOW.
- Using a complete column or row as a reference than the data set range.
- Using complex formulas; VLOOKUP in place of Index/Match, Nested If in place of MAXIFS, MINIFS.
- Calculations or reference across workbooks.

**Related:** [How to Fix Formatting Issues in Excel](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/)

### 2\. Abrupt System Shutdown

Shutting down the system without following the procedure can corrupt your data file.

This shut down can be due to a power failure or any other unexpected technical challenges.

So it is always important to follow the procedures and shut down your system properly to avoid data losses.

### 3\. Infected Excel File (Virus Attack)

This is the most common and obvious reason for Excel file corruption.

Although we always keep our system safe using various Antiviruses, still there is always a probability of virus attacks and loss of important files.

It is always advised to use a safe and strong antivirus compatible with your system requirements.

## What are the Signs to Know When an Excel File is Corrupted?

In this section, we will discuss what are the signs which you can get when an Excel file is corrupted, let’s dig into it.

### 1\. The File is Corrupt and Cannot Be Opened

This is one of the most common messages you can see when your workbook is corrupted.

But there is also a chance that it is just because of the version compatibility where you have a .xls file but you are using the latest version of Excel check out this detailed post by Priyanka

### 2\. We Found a Problem with some Content in this File…

There’s another error message which you can get while opening a file:

We Found a Problem with some content in Do you want us to recover as much as we can? If you trust the source of this workbook, click yes.

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/Mac-Regional/we-found-a-problem-with-some-content-in-this-file.jpg)

There are a lot of applications out there (I think almost every) which exports the data as a .xls format. Those files have a greater chance of having this kind of error.

### 3\. “Filename.xls” cannot be accessed

There can also be a situation where you get the error:

_“Filename.xls” cannot be accessed. The file may be corrupted, located on a server that is not responding._

Well, this message is a bit misleading.

You won't be able to decide that your file is actually corrupted or just not on the location.

## My Excel File Got Corrupted, now What Should I Do?

There are many ways to recover the data from the corrupt excel files. But before you start, it is always advised to create a copy of the corrupted file.

You can save a lot of time with [**Stellar Repair for Excel,**](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/) which make data recovery just with few clicks.

But before you go for a data recovery software, let's try out some manual steps which can help.

When a workbook get corrupted the first thing comes to the mind is to recover data from it…

...and you what there’s a simple option there in the Excel which you can use to do this. Below are the steps you need to follow:

- First of all, open the Excel and click on the office icon.

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/Mac-Regional/office-icon.jpg)

- After that, go to the “Open” and select the file which is corrupted.

- Now, click on the open drop-down and select “Open and Repair”.

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/Mac-Regional/open-repair.jpg)

- At this point, you have two options:

1. **Repair File**
2. **Extract Data**

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/Mac-Regional/extract-data.jpg)

Let’s get into both of these options one by one...

### 1\. Repair File

This option helps you to repair the file and the moment you click on it it takes a few seconds afterward and shows you the result with a message box and also provide you a log file.

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/Mac-Regional/repair-file.jpg)

And once it is done with repairing, you'll get your file opened and you can save that file as a new copy.

Yes, that’s it.

### 2\. Extract Data

If somehow you aren’t able to get your file repaired, you can also extract data from that file using “Extract Data” option.

Even in this option, you can get data in two ways.

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/Mac-Regional/open-repair-options.png)

1. **As Values**
2. **With Formulas**

In the first option, Excel simply extracts data as value ignoring all the formulas driving those value (which is **the best way if you just need to have that data back** ).

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/Mac-Regional/open-repai-values.jpg)

But in the second option, Excel tries to recover the formulas as much as possible.

Check out this [**smart technique by Jyoti**](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/) which you can use it you aren’t able to recover data from the file.

## Preventions to Not to have any Excel File Go Corrupt in Future

Future is fragile, what I’m trying to say is the more you work in Excel and process data there could be a chance that your workbook goes corrupt.

If there’s no security then what an EXCEL POWER user should do?

Well, there are few things which you can do or take care of while working with Excel so that you won’t have to worry about corruption of Excel workbooks.

Let’s see what you can do…

### 1\. Change Recalculation Option

Now here’s the thing when you work with a hell lot of data, there a common thing that you gotta using formulas. Right?

But, the thing these formulas are something which makes your Excel file slows down sometimes make them go corrupt.

There’s one small tweak you can do in your workbook is change the calculation method.

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/Mac-Regional/change-recalculation-option.jpg)

Now with the manual calculation, you just need to whenever you open your file it won’t recalculate all the formulas.

And when you update your data you can simply click on the “Calculate Now” and it will calculate all the formulas again.

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/Mac-Regional/calculate-now.jpg)

**Quick Tip:** Beware of Volatile Functions and use them with caution as recalculates them every time you change something in the worksheet.

### 2\. Use VBA Codes Instead of Formulas

Now, this is what I do when I need to use complex formulas in a workbook.

Here’s how you can do this: Let’s say you have a formula in the cell A1, like below, which calculates the age.

\="You age is "& DATEDIF(Date-of-Birth,TODAY(),"y") &" Year(s), "& DATEDIF(Date-of-Birth,TODAY(),"ym")& " Month(s) & "& DATEDIF(Date-of-Birth,TODAY(),"md")& " Day(s)."

Now, instead of simply entering it into the cell A1 which I would write a macro code which inserts this formula into the cell A1 and then convert it into the a value.

**Here’s the code:**

Sub CalculateAge()  
Range("B1").Value = \_  
"=""Your age is """ & \_  
"&DATEDIF(A1,TODAY(),""y"")" & \_  
"&"" Year(s), """ & \_  
"&DATEDIF(A1,TODAY(),""ym"")" & \_  
"&"" Month(s), and """ & \_  
"&DATEDIF(A1,TODAY(),""md"")" & \_  
"&"" Days(s)."""  
Range("B1") = Range("B1").Value  
End Sub

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/Mac-Regional/VBA-codes.jpg)

**Note:** To write these code you need to have basic understading of VBA (make sure [check out this guide](https://excelchamps.com/learn-vba/) for this).

### 3\. Use a File Recovery Application

Recently we asked a quick question to our readers on ExcelChamps that if they have ever faced a situation where they got a corruption message in Excel.

You’ll be astonied to hear that 50% percent of the people said “YES” they faced this thing in the past.

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/Mac-Regional/yesr.jpg)

Now, this is alarming, if you are heading a team or you have a bunch of people in your company who use Excel…

…there’s a high probability that half of them gonna face this issue. So the best way to deal with this to have an App FIX your Excel file for you.

With **STELLAR REPAIR FOR EXCEL,** you just need a few clicks, yes that’s right. Let me show you with the below steps:

When trying to save the Excel file, you might face unexpected errors. The “Errors were detected while saving Excel” is one such error. It can also occur when using VBA in Excel. The complete error message appears as:

**“Errors were detected while saving \[file name\]. Microsoft Excel may be able to save the file by removing or repairing some features. To make the repairs in a new file, click Continue. To cancel saving the file, click Cancel.”  
**

The error can occur if the features (Pivot tables, charts, macros) used in the [Excel file get corrupted](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/). However, there could be several other reasons behind the occurrence of the error. Let’s discuss them.

## **What Causes the "Errors were detected while saving Excel" Error?**

There are various reasons why you encounter this error. Here are some of them:

- Incompatible pivot table in the Excel file
- Large or uncompressed images in the Excel file
- File-sharing properties are not allowing file saving
- Excel file is corrupted
- Large-sized Excel file
- File version incompatibility
- VBA code is corrupted

## **Ways to Fix the “Errors were detected while saving Excel” Error**

You’re not able to save the Excel file if there is no storage space on your hard drive. So, first check if your hard drive has sufficient storage space to save the file. If this is not the case, then it might happen that your antivirus program is interrupting the saving process. To check this, temporarily disable your antivirus program and then try to save the file. If still your Excel is throwing the “Errors were detected while saving Excel” error, then follow the below given methods to fix the error:

###  **Method 1: Open the Excel in Safe Mode and Disable the Add-ins**

When you open Excel in safe mode, it opens without the third-party add-ins. This helps in finding out if any add-ins are causing the error.

 Here’s how to open the Excel in safe mode:

- Open the Run window by pressing **Windows key + R**.
- Type **excel /safe** in the Run window.  

    ![Excel Save Mode Command](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/errorsweredetected/excel-save-mode-command.jpg)?

- Next, click on **OK**.
- It will open Excel in safe mode.
- Now, try to open and save the affected file.

If you are able to save the file without any issue, then this means that the error has occurred due to third-party add-ins or settings. You can try disabling the add-ins to fix the issue. To do this, follow these steps:

- First, open Excel.
- Then, go to the **File** tab and click **Options**.

![Go To Options Window](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/errorsweredetected/go-to-options-window.jpg)

- In **Excel Options**, click on the **Add-ins**

![Select Add-ins](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/errorsweredetected/select-add-ins4.jpg)

- Under the **Manage** section, select **Excel Add-ins** and then click on the **Go**

![Excel Add-ins Drop-down](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/errorsweredetected/excel-add-ins-drop-down.jpg)

    ![Add-ins Window](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/errorsweredetected/add-ins-window.jpg)

**_Note_**_: Disabling add-ins does not remove them from the system. To remove them permanently, you need to uninstall them._

### **Method 2: Check the Excel File Name**

Some users have observed this error when saving the Excel file with an invalid name. You can check the file name and ensure that it should not contain more than 218 characters. If the name exceeds the required limit, then try shortening the file name or move the file to a folder with a short path name.

###  **Method 3: Copy the Data from the Affected File to a New File**

If you are not able to save the Excel document, then try copying the data from the affected file to a new Excel file. Then, save the new file with a different name. This helps in resolving the issue.

### **Method 4: Check and Provide File Permissions**

You may experience the “Errors were detected while saving Excel" issue when you do not have desired permissions to modify the folder in which your Excel file is located. To modify the folder, you should have read, write, and create permissions. You can check and provide the desired permissions using the below steps:

- Navigate to the Windows **Program Files** and then find the desired folder (where the Excel file is saved).
- Right-click on the folder and then choose **Properties**.
- Select the **Security** tab and then click
- Click on **Change Permissions** in the **Advanced Settings**
- Click **Administrators** and then click **Edit**.
- Now set the **Apply to drop-down** button to **This Folder, Subfolder, and Files**.
- Click on the **Full Control** field and then click **Apply > OK**.

###  **Method 5: Check Pivot Tables in Excel Sheet**

You can review Pivot tables to see if they are causing the “Errors were detected while saving Excel” error. To do so, follow the below steps:

- Click **Power Pivot > Manage**.  

    ![Check Pivot Table In Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/errorsweredetected/check-pivot-table-in-excel.jpg)

- Check the tabs in the **Power Pivot**
- Check if all the formulas used in the table are correct. Sometimes, even a small typo can create an issue in Excel.

### **Method 6: Repair Your Excel File**

The “Errors were detected while saving Excel” issue can also occur if the Excel file is corrupted. In such a case, you can take the help of the built-in utility in Excel – Open and Repair to repair your Excel file. Here’s how to use the tool:
