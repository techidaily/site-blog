- On the right pane, you will see **USB Device Tree**. If you see your iPhone in the list, then update to the latest macOS.

### **6\. Update iTunes**

Older versions of iTunes can create conflict with normal Mac functions. Hence, Apple recommends installing the latest iTunes updates.

To install the latest iTunes, open iTunes. From the menu bar choose **Help > Check for Updates** and follow the prompts to install the latest version.

Now, check if your Mac recognizes the iPhone or not.

### **7\. Disable antivirus on Mac**

One of the reason cited for **iPhone not detected by Mac** is anti-virus or firewall protection on your system. So disable the antivirus or firewall and then try to connect your iPhone to Mac.

### **8\. Enable iOS device in Mac Preferences**

When iPhone is not showing on Mac Finder, check if your Mac Preferences allows to view iOS devices in Finder. To enable iOS device in Finder follow the below steps:

- Go to **Finder > Preferences.**
- Click on the **Sidebar** button in Finder Preferences box.
- Check in **CDs, DVDs and iOS Devices**.

![Finder Preferences](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-8b4e845/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Mac-Finder-Preferences-Sidebar-Image-3-1.png)
