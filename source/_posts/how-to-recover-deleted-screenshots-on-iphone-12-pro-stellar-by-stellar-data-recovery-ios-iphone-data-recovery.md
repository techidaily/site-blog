- Slow or unstable WiFi connection.
- Numerous unwanted backup files stored on iCloud.

Generally, restoring in progress doesn’t take more than 20 to 60 minutes for an iPhone to restart. Nonetheless, if restoring is stuck beyond that time, then be wary that it might take hours to finish. Anyhow, iPhone offers you ample options to get around a stuck iCloud backup.

### **How to restart an iPhone stuck at “Restore from iCloud- Time Remaining: Estimating”**

Read the below methods to identify a perfect route to finish restoring iPhone 14 from iCloud backup. You can also stop restoring your iPhone and experiment with other alternatives:

#### **Cancel the iCloud Restore in Progress**

Stop the **‘Restore from iCloud’** process and start afresh after giving rest to your iPhone for a while. The move allows iOS device to optimize operations after turning off all the activities. To do so, you need to interrupt the ongoing restore from iCloud backup, which is already stuck at a specified time remaining. Rebooting your iPhone will fix all the minor glitches liable for creating such. Follow these steps:

- Press and hold the side button (on the right hand side of your iPhone) along with volume up/ down button till the power-off slider appears on your iPhone 14 screen.

- Drag the slider to your right and wait for 30-seconds to turn off the device.

#### **Restart Restoring iCloud Backup**

Once your iPhone 14 restarts, follow these steps to restore iCloud backup:

- Go to **Settings** > **General** > **Transfer or Reset iPhone** > **Reset** > **Reset All Settings**.

- Set up your iPhone and select Restore from iCloud Backup on the Apps & Data screen.
- You can also choose another restoration option- Transfer Directly from iPhone.
- Follow the instruction available on-screen to restore your iOS device.

If your new iPhone 14 continues getting stuck at iCloud restore progress, then you need to check your internet connection. Also, make sure the iOS device has adequate space to handle large volume of data you are trying to copy in it.

### **Check the iCloud System Status**

At rare occasions, even Apple server prevents the iCloud data restoration. The first thing you can do in such situations is to ascertain whether the restore process was stalled because of an internet issue or iCloud System Status. To do so, go to Apple system status page and check if iCloud Backup, Apple ID, and iCloud Account and Sign In, are working. If not, then you can’t do much but wait for Apple support to fix the issue at their end.

iCloud backup restore stuck while setting up a new iPhone 14 is not stressful until you lose a significant amount of data in the process. It is possible that in the search and trial of different options to restore iCloud backup on new iPhone 14, you might lose a significant amount of data. Use a reliable iPhone data recovery software like [Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/data-recovery-ios/) to restore all the lost or deleted iPhone data from different variants of iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch.
