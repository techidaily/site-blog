## How to Fix a Corrupted .xls File? The Everything Guide

Undoubtedly, Excel is so powerful that it can help you to process, analysis, and store data, in masses.

That’s the reason it has been there for years and helping this world in data.

But…

With all those powers comes some nasty problems which no Excel users like to face. Can you guess what I’m talking about?

Think about a Corrupted Excel File. Nightmare? Isn’t it?

And do you remember that last time when you have opened a workbook and you got a message that this workbook is might corrupt?

The TRUTH is, this is something which you cannot avoid, but, you can [prepare yourself in the best way](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/) and deal with it like a PRO.

So today, in this post, I’d like to share with you to everything you need to know about a corrupt Excel file (.xls), why it happens, how to fix it like a PRO, and much more.

...let’s get started.

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/Mac-Regional/introduction.jpg)

**Note**: In this post, we’ll be covering the .xls version (which is the extension for the file which is created in Excel 2007 or the earlier versions) and if you want to know about the new version, [here’s the quick fix](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/) for that.

## Why My Excel File Got Corrupted?

There can be one or multiple reasons for an Excel file to get corrupted. Below I have detailed about some of the major of them.

### 1\. Large Excel File

You can store data in a workbook the way you want but sometimes using excessive thing can make an Excel file bigger in size.

And that kind of data files can crash at any point in time. Here are a few things which make the Excel files heavy, like

- Conditional Formatting.
- Colors formatting.
- Using merged cells in place of text alignment.
- Volatile functions: Formulae that iterate every time you open or change a cell value; OFFSET, NOW.
- Using a complete column or row as a reference than the data set range.
- Using complex formulas; VLOOKUP in place of Index/Match, Nested If in place of MAXIFS, MINIFS.
- Calculations or reference across workbooks.

**Related:** [How to Fix Formatting Issues in Excel](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/)

### 2\. Abrupt System Shutdown

Shutting down the system without following the procedure can corrupt your data file.

This shut down can be due to a power failure or any other unexpected technical challenges.

So it is always important to follow the procedures and shut down your system properly to avoid data losses.

### 3\. Infected Excel File (Virus Attack)

This is the most common and obvious reason for Excel file corruption.

Although we always keep our system safe using various Antiviruses, still there is always a probability of virus attacks and loss of important files.

It is always advised to use a safe and strong antivirus compatible with your system requirements.

## What are the Signs to Know When an Excel File is Corrupted?

In this section, we will discuss what are the signs which you can get when an Excel file is corrupted, let’s dig into it.

### 1\. The File is Corrupt and Cannot Be Opened

This is one of the most common messages you can see when your workbook is corrupted.

But there is also a chance that it is just because of the version compatibility where you have a .xls file but you are using the latest version of Excel check out this detailed post by Priyanka

### 2\. We Found a Problem with some Content in this File…

There’s another error message which you can get while opening a file:

We Found a Problem with some content in Do you want us to recover as much as we can? If you trust the source of this workbook, click yes.

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/Mac-Regional/we-found-a-problem-with-some-content-in-this-file.jpg)

There are a lot of applications out there (I think almost every) which exports the data as a .xls format. Those files have a greater chance of having this kind of error.

### 3\. “Filename.xls” cannot be accessed

There can also be a situation where you get the error:

_“Filename.xls” cannot be accessed. The file may be corrupted, located on a server that is not responding._

Well, this message is a bit misleading.

You won't be able to decide that your file is actually corrupted or just not on the location.

## My Excel File Got Corrupted, now What Should I Do?

There are many ways to recover the data from the corrupt excel files. But before you start, it is always advised to create a copy of the corrupted file.

You can save a lot of time with [**Stellar Repair for Excel,**](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/) which make data recovery just with few clicks.

But before you go for a data recovery software, let's try out some manual steps which can help.

When a workbook get corrupted the first thing comes to the mind is to recover data from it…

...and you what there’s a simple option there in the Excel which you can use to do this. Below are the steps you need to follow:

- First of all, open the Excel and click on the office icon.

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/Mac-Regional/office-icon.jpg)

- After that, go to the “Open” and select the file which is corrupted.

- Now, click on the open drop-down and select “Open and Repair”.

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/Mac-Regional/open-repair.jpg)

- At this point, you have two options:

1. **Repair File**
2. **Extract Data**

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/Mac-Regional/extract-data.jpg)

Let’s get into both of these options one by one...

### 1\. Repair File

This option helps you to repair the file and the moment you click on it it takes a few seconds afterward and shows you the result with a message box and also provide you a log file.

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/Mac-Regional/repair-file.jpg)

And once it is done with repairing, you'll get your file opened and you can save that file as a new copy.

Yes, that’s it.

### 2\. Extract Data

If somehow you aren’t able to get your file repaired, you can also extract data from that file using “Extract Data” option.

Even in this option, you can get data in two ways.

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/Mac-Regional/open-repair-options.png)

1. **As Values**
2. **With Formulas**

In the first option, Excel simply extracts data as value ignoring all the formulas driving those value (which is **the best way if you just need to have that data back** ).

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/Mac-Regional/open-repai-values.jpg)

But in the second option, Excel tries to recover the formulas as much as possible.

Check out this [**smart technique by Jyoti**](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/) which you can use it you aren’t able to recover data from the file.

## Preventions to Not to have any Excel File Go Corrupt in Future

Future is fragile, what I’m trying to say is the more you work in Excel and process data there could be a chance that your workbook goes corrupt.

If there’s no security then what an EXCEL POWER user should do?

Well, there are few things which you can do or take care of while working with Excel so that you won’t have to worry about corruption of Excel workbooks.

Let’s see what you can do…

### 1\. Change Recalculation Option

Now here’s the thing when you work with a hell lot of data, there a common thing that you gotta using formulas. Right?

But, the thing these formulas are something which makes your Excel file slows down sometimes make them go corrupt.

There’s one small tweak you can do in your workbook is change the calculation method.

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/Mac-Regional/change-recalculation-option.jpg)

Now with the manual calculation, you just need to whenever you open your file it won’t recalculate all the formulas.

And when you update your data you can simply click on the “Calculate Now” and it will calculate all the formulas again.

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/Mac-Regional/calculate-now.jpg)

**Quick Tip:** Beware of Volatile Functions and use them with caution as recalculates them every time you change something in the worksheet.

### 2\. Use VBA Codes Instead of Formulas

Now, this is what I do when I need to use complex formulas in a workbook.

Here’s how you can do this: Let’s say you have a formula in the cell A1, like below, which calculates the age.

\="You age is "& DATEDIF(Date-of-Birth,TODAY(),"y") &" Year(s), "& DATEDIF(Date-of-Birth,TODAY(),"ym")& " Month(s) & "& DATEDIF(Date-of-Birth,TODAY(),"md")& " Day(s)."

Now, instead of simply entering it into the cell A1 which I would write a macro code which inserts this formula into the cell A1 and then convert it into the a value.

**Here’s the code:**

Sub CalculateAge()  
Range("B1").Value = \_  
"=""Your age is """ & \_  
"&DATEDIF(A1,TODAY(),""y"")" & \_  
"&"" Year(s), """ & \_  
"&DATEDIF(A1,TODAY(),""ym"")" & \_  
"&"" Month(s), and """ & \_  
"&DATEDIF(A1,TODAY(),""md"")" & \_  
"&"" Days(s)."""  
Range("B1") = Range("B1").Value  
End Sub

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/Mac-Regional/VBA-codes.jpg)

**Note:** To write these code you need to have basic understading of VBA (make sure [check out this guide](https://excelchamps.com/learn-vba/) for this).

### 3\. Use a File Recovery Application

Recently we asked a quick question to our readers on ExcelChamps that if they have ever faced a situation where they got a corruption message in Excel.

You’ll be astonied to hear that 50% percent of the people said “YES” they faced this thing in the past.

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/Mac-Regional/yesr.jpg)

Now, this is alarming, if you are heading a team or you have a bunch of people in your company who use Excel…

…there’s a high probability that half of them gonna face this issue. So the best way to deal with this to have an App FIX your Excel file for you.

With **STELLAR REPAIR FOR EXCEL,** you just need a few clicks, yes that’s right. Let me show you with the below steps:

- First of all, download the app and install it (it’s simple).

[![download](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/free-download-1.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/)

## \[Fixed\] Excel VBA Runtime Error 9: Subscript Out of Range

**Summary:** The runtime error 9 in Excel usually occurs when you use different objects in a code or the object you are trying to use is not defined. This post will discuss the reasons behind the Excel VBA error "Subscript out of Range” and the solutions to resolve the issue. It will also mention an Excel repair tool that can help fix the error if it occurs due to corruption in worksheet.

[![Free Download for Windows](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/free-download-windows.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/ "Free Download for Windows")

Many users have reported encountering the error “Subscript out of range” (runtime error 9) when using VBA code in Excel. The error often occurs when the object you are referring to in a code is not available, deleted, or not defined earlier. Sometimes, it occurs if you have declared an array in code but forgot to specify the DIM or ReDIM statement to define the length of array.

## **Causes of VBA Runtime Error 9: Subscript Out Of Range**

The error ‘Subscript out of range’ in Excel can occur due to several reasons, such as:

- Object you are trying to use in the VBA code is not defined earlier or is deleted.
- Entered a wrong declaration syntax of the array.
- Wrong spelling of the variable name.
- Referenced a wrong array element.
- Entered incorrect name of the worksheet you are trying to refer.
- Worksheet you trying to call in the code is not available.
- Specified an invalid element.
- Not specified the number of elements in an array.
- Workbook in which you trying to use VBA is corrupted.

## **Methods to Fix Excel VBA Error ‘Subscript out of Range’**

Following are some workarounds you can try to fix the runtime error 9 in Excel.

### **Method 1: Check the Name of Worksheet in the Code**

Sometimes, Excel throws the runtime error 9: Subscript out of range if the name of the worksheet is not defined correctly in the code. For example – When trying to copy content from one Excel sheet (emp) to another sheet (emp2) via VBA code, you have mistakenly mentioned wrong name of the worksheet (see the below code).

```
Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()
Worksheets("emp").Range("A1:E5").Select
Selection.Copy
Worksheets("emp3").Activate
Worksheets("emp3").Range("A1:E5").Select
ActiveSheet.Paste
Application.CutCopyMode = False
End Sub
```

![VBA Error Subscript Out Of Range-When Incorrect Name](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/VBA-error-subscript-out-of-range-when-incorrect-name.jpg)

When you run the above code, the Excel will throw the Subscript out of range error.

So, check the name of the worksheet and correct it. Here are the steps:

- Go to the **Design** tab in the **Developer** section.
- Double-click on the **Command** button.
- Check and modify the worksheet name (e.g. from “emp” to “emp2”).

![Modified Code From emp to emp2](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/modified-code-from-emp-to-emp2.jpg)

- Now run the code.
- The content in ‘emp’ worksheet will be copied to ‘emp2’ (see below).

![Content Copied From emp to emp2](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/content-copied-from-emp-to-emp2.jpg)

### Method 2: Check the Range of the Array

The VBA error “Subscript out of range” also occurs if you have declared an array in a code but didn’t specify the number of elements. For example – If you have declared an array and forgot to declare the array variable with elements, you will get the error (see below):

![Runtime Error 9 When Not Declared Array](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/run-time-error-9-when-not-declared-array.jpg)

To fix this, specify the array variable:

```
Sub FillArray()
Dim curExpense(364) As Currency
Dim intI As Integer
For intI = 0 to 364
curExpense(intI) = 20
Next
End Sub
```

### **Method 3: Change Macro Security Settings**

The Runtime error 9: Subscript out of range can also occur if there is an issue with the macros or macros are disabled in the Macro Security Settings. In such a case, you can check and change the macro settings. Follow these steps:

- Open your Microsoft Excel.
- Navigate to **File > Options > Trust Center**.
- Under **Trust Center**, select **Trust Center Settings**.
- Click **Macro Settings**, select **Enable all macros**, and then click **OK**.

![Macro Settings In Trust Center](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/macro-settings-in-trust-center.jpg)

### **Method 4: Repair your Excel File**

The name or format of the Excel file or name of the objects may get changed due to corruption in the file. When the objects are not identified in a VBA code, you may encounter the Subscript out of range error. You can use the Open and Repair utility in Excel to repair the corrupted file.

## 'Unable to Save Excel Workbook' Issue [Fix 2024]

**Summary:** You may unable to save your Excel Workbooks due to several reasons. Many users have reported this issue on the Tech Forums. This blog will discuss a few instances when users cannot save their Excel files. It lists the causes behind the issue and their possible solutions. It also mentions the Stellar Repair for Excel to fix the saving error if it is due to corruption in the Excel file.

[![Free Download for Windows](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/free-download-windows.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/ "Free Download for Windows")

It is easy to work with Microsoft Excel but sometimes, the application may create issues thereby hampering the smooth functioning of the workbook. One such issue is “unable to Save Excel Workbook”.

## Let’s take a look at the issue of Unable to Save Excel Workbook

### **Instance 1:**

In an organization, users connected to one of the servers (Windows 2008 R2) using Citrix – a Terminal Server configured with Windows 2008 R2 –and accessed their data through a File Server, also configured with Windows 2008R2. Since the connectivity to Shared Drive was established through a Terminal server, any conflict amongst the server configuration may create conflict in shared file.

This issue was discussed at length at one of the [Tech Forums](https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/371563-excel-document-not-saved-issue), where the users were unable to access their workbooks stored on the shared drive. The File menu did not work. As a result, the users were forced to save the workbook by creating quick access shortcuts or locally on the desktop. In many cases, the saving option was ruled out completely.

### **Instance 2:**

A [similar problem](https://www.dell.com/support/article/in/en/indhs1/sln308103/unable-to-save-workbook-in-microsoft-excel?lang=en) was reported, wherein the users received an error when saving an Excel workbook after inserting a chart in an existing workbook (previously saved) or copying values from an existing workbook. A system is configured with Windows 7 and Microsoft Office 10 configuration. The issue arises when the user is unable to save the changes after editing in a saved spreadsheet. The following message displays on the screen:

![Image of Error message while trying to save excel file](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Excel-Error.png)

Figure: Unable to Save Excel WorkBook Issue

**Further, if the user clicks ‘Continue’, the following error message is received:**

“Excel encountered errors during save. However, Excel was able to minimally save your file to <**filename.xlsx**\>”.

**Note:** This issue impacts build Version 1707 (Build 8326.2086) and later, and also only occurs with files that are stored locally, such as on the desktop. This problem does not occur if you manually enter values or insert a chart in a newly created workbook.

## Plausible reasons for the ‘Unable to save Excel workbook’ Issue

1. The issue was detected in Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2010 32-bit, Service Pack 14.0.6029.1000.
2. Excel version on the user system may or may not match with Excel version on File server.
3. The issue of ‘Unable to Save Excel Workbook’ impacts only the Build Version 1707 (Build 8326.2086) and later.
4. In case of Issue 2, the problem surfaces when the user adds files, tables or charts in the locally saved excel files, such as on the desktop.

## Methods to fix the ‘Unable to Save Excel Workbook’ Issue

There may be an issue with the Build version or the Registry Values settings may not be appropriate, which does not allow the Excel workbooks to save.

**But, before starting to resolve the issue, verify the following:**

1. **The location where the file is to be saved may not have enough space to save the Excel file**: Check the available space and save again. You may also use the option of ‘Save As’ to save the file at a new location.
2. **Excel file may be a shared one where edits are not allowed by a specific user**: There are restrictions attached to documents and other files shared over the network. Check for these restrictions.
3. **Antivirus may interrupt in during file saving**: Antivirus in the system may not allow saving of the files. Request the system administrator to uninstall the antivirus and reinstall after saving.
4. **The file is not saved within 218 characters**: If the file is not saved due to the naming issue, then check the character length and try again.
5. **Differences in Windows versions** of the local system and those on network drive may cause excel not saved issues. Check that all the systems have the same configuration and are updated to the recently available versions.
6. **Excel spreadsheet is corrupt**: If none of the above factors have not caused hindrance in saving the file, then there may be a probability of [corruption in the Excel spreadsheet](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/simple-way-to-open-corrupt-excel-file-without-any-backup/).

Once verified, look for a healthy and restorable backup. If backup is missing, resolve the issue of “Unable to open Excel File” with manual settings on local system or through a reliable Excel repair software.

### Method 1: Modify Registry Entries

If multiple users are unable to access their workbooks stored on the shared drive and facing unable to save Excel file problem (see Instance 1 above), then follow the below steps:

1. Go to ‘Registry Entry’. To do this, type ‘regedit’ in the Start Search box, and press ENTER

## Solutions to Fix MS Excel Crash Issue

Following are some solutions to resolve problems with MS Excel such as,

- Excel not responding
- Excel won't open
- Excel keeps crashing

Follow these solutions in the given order. In case a method doesn't work, move to the next one.

### Solution 1: Restart Excel in Safe Mode

By starting MS Excel in safe mode, you can run the program without loading the Excel add-ins and with limited features. But COM add-ins are excluded.

To launch Excel in safe mode, close MS Excel and follow these steps,

- Create a shortcut of MS Excel (.exe) on Desktop
- Press and hold the Ctrl key while launching the program
- Click 'Yes' when a prompt appears to confirm

Alternatively, press Windows+R, type excel /safe and press 'Enter'. Use this to open Excel in safe mode on Windows 10, 8.1, 8, or 7 system.

![type excel /safe](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/article/excel8.jpg)

Now try to open and access the Excel file and check if the issue is resolved. If it's not, head on to the next solution.

### Solution 2: Check and Remove Faulty Add-ins

In case Excel doesn't crash in Safe Mode, it's possible that some faulty add-ins are the culprit behind frequent Excel crash and freeze. These Excel add-ins may interfere or conflict with the Excel program.

![Check and Remove Faulty Add-ins](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/article/excel9.jpg)

Find and remove the faulty add-in. It can resolve the issue. To do so, follow these steps,

- Restart Excel in normal mode and go to File> Options> Add-ins
- Choose COM Add-ins from the drop-down and click Go

![COM Add-ins](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/article/excel10.jpg)

- Uncheck all the checkboxes and click OK

![Uncheck all the check boxes](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/article/excel11.jpg)

- Restart Excel and check if the issue is resolved
-  If Excel doesn't crash or freeze anymore, open COM Add-ins and enable one add-in at a time followed by Excel restart. Then observe Excel for freeze or crash problem

This will help you find out the faulty add-in, which is causing the problem. Remove the add-in which is causing the problem to resolve the issue. If that doesn't fix, move to the next solution.

### Solution 3: Check and Install the Latest Updates

If you haven't set Windows to Download and Install Updates automatically, do it now.

Apart from updating the operating system, latest Windows updates sometimes fixes bugs for other applications installed on the system such as MS Office. Often installing an important update that you might have missed may correct the Excel crash problem.

You can also update MS Office manually. Follow these steps,

Go to File > Account

 Under Product Information, select Update Options and click Update Now

![Product Information](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/article/excel12.jpg)

If you have installed MS Excel from Microsoft Store, open the store and update your Office applications.

NOTE: This also works if you can't open Excel file or Excel crashes after Windows upgrade from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to Windows 10.

After installing the latest MS Office updates, check if Excel works fine. If not, head to the next solution.

### Solution 4: Clear Conditional Formatting Rules

If a sheet is causing Excel to freeze or crash, there might be a problem with that particular sheet. In such a case, you may try clearing the Conditional Formatting rules. The steps are as follows,

- Under Home, click 'Conditional Formatting > Clear Rules\> Clear Rules from Entire Sheet'

![Conditional Formatting](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/article/excel13.jpg)

- You may repeat this step for all other sheets in the Excel workbook
- Then click File> Save as and save the Sheet as a new file at a different location

This avoids overwriting or making changes to the original Excel file. Once done, try working on the sheet.

If this doesn't work out, move to the next solution.

### Solution 5: Remove Multiple Cell Formatting and Styles

If a workbook is being shared and edited by others on different platforms then it's possible that many cells are formatted differently. This can cause issues with Excel such as crash and freeze. It can also lead to Excel file corruption. The problem mostly occurs when a workbook contains multiple worksheets using different formatting.

You can [follow this guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/troubleshoot/excel/too-many-different-cell-formats-in-excel) to remove different cell formats and styles, and then open the Excel file.

### Solution 6: Disable Microsoft Excel Animation

Animations require additional processing power and resources. By disabling animations in Excel, you may resolve Excel freeze and crash issue. This also improves MS Excel performance.

To disable the animations in MS Excel, follow these steps:

- Go to File > Options
- Click 'Advanced' and check 'Disable hardware graphics acceleration'animation

![Disable hardware graphics acceleration](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/article/excel14.jpg)

- Click 'OK' to close the window and then restart MS Excel

This has helped many users in fixing the Excel crash issue. If it doesn't work for you, head to the next solution.

### Solution 7: Check If Excel File is Generated by a Third-Party Application

There are applications which you may have used to generate Excel files to fetch data. For instance, downloading data from Google Analytics in Excel format.

Sometimes, these Excel files are not generated correctly by such third-party apps. Thus, some features in Excel may not work as intended when you access the files in MS Excel.

In such a case, you should get in touch with the app developer for help with the file or use Stellar Repair for Excel to repair such Excel files.

### Solution 8: Check If Antivirus or Other Apps are Conflicting with MS Excel

Ensure your antivirus is up-to-date and not conflicting with MS Excel. An outdated antivirus tool may conflict with Excel which can cause the application to hang, freeze, or crash.

- Update your antivirus
- Try disabling the add-in or integration between Excel and antivirus. See if it works

Alternatively, you may disable the anti-virus tool temporarily to check if it is the culprit behind Excel performance issue and crash. If that resolves the problem, get in touch with your antivirus vendor and report the problem.

They might provide you with a better solution or workaround to fix this problem without disabling the antivirus protection.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Disabling or altering antivirus protection makes your PC vulnerable to malicious attacks and virus or malware intrusion.

### Solution 9: Clean Boot Windows to Inspect the Cause Behind Excel Crash

When Windows boot, it starts several processes, services, and application during start up automatically, which runs in the background.

These startup apps and services can interfere with other applications such as MS Excel. To find out if that's the cause behind Excel crash, you can perform a Clean Boot.

This helps you identify processes, services, or applications that are conflicting with Excel. Steps to perform Clean Boot are as follows,

- Press Windows key + R, type MSConfig, and press 'Enter'
- In System Configuration window, click on the General tab and choose Selective startup

![System Configuration](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/article/excel15.jpg)

Uncheck 'Load startup items' and click 'OK'

After this, close all running applications and restart your PC

Check if the crash problem with Excel is resolved. Uninstall the conflicting apps or update them. If your issue is not resolved, follow the next solution.

### Solution 10: Repair or Reinstall MS Office

Repairing Office programs may also resolve Excel crash issues if caused by damaged MS Excel program or MS Office files. The steps are as follow,

- Close all MS Office apps and open the Control Panel
- Click Uninstall a program under Programs

![Uninstall a program](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/article/excel16.jpg)

- Click on Microsoft Office and then click on the Change option
- Choose 'Quick repair' and then select 'Repair'

## How to Fix the #Value! Error in Excel?

**Summary:** #Value! is a common error that occurs when using formulas in Excel. It can be due to an issue with the cells you are referencing or use of formulas in the wrong type or format. This blog will discuss some cases when this error may occur and the solutions to fix the issue. You’ll also find about an Excel repair software that can help fix the error if it has occurred due to corruption in Excel file.

[![Free Download for Windows](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/free-download-windows.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/ "Free Download for Windows")

You may experience the #Value! error in Excel when trying to enter invalid data type into the formulas. Sometimes, it appears when a value is not the expected type or when dates are given a text value. This Excel error may occur due to several reasons. However, the exact cause of this error is difficult to find. Below, we will be discussing some cases where you may get this error and the solutions to resolve the issues.

## Case 1: Wrong Argument Data Type in Formulas

Sometimes, Excel throws the “#Value!” error if it recognizes incompatible arguments in the formulas.

For example: The Date function in the sheet expects only numerical values as arguments. In the below image you can see that when the formula’s string value is used in the month (January), it resulted in the #VALUE! error.

![Image of #Value! error in Date Function](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/date-function-error.png)

**Solution**

To fix the issue,

- Double-click the formula to verify the type of arguments.

![Image of Solution to fix #Value! error in Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/verify-type-of-arguments-in-formulas.png)

- Correct the argument in the cell (B2).

![Image of Correcting Argument In Cell to fix #Value! error in Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/correcting-argument-in-the-cell.png)

The formula will work as expected.

## Case 2: Using the Basic Subtraction Formula

Users often experience the #Value! error, when using the basic subtraction formula in Excel.

![Image of #Value! error in Excel in Subtraction Formula ](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/subtraction-formula-error-window.png)

**Solution**

Check the formula and the type of values in the cell. If these are correct and the error persists, then follow these steps:

![Image of Correcting Basic Subtraction Formula to fix #Value! error in Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/correcting-basic-subtraction-formula.png)

- Go to the **Start** button on Windows, type **Control Panel**, and double-click on it.
- Click **Clock and Region > Region.**

![Image of Clock And Region Window in Control Panel to #Value! error in Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/clock-and-region-window.png)

- On the **Format** tab, click **Additional Settings.**

![Image of Region Window For Additional Settings](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/region-window-for-additional-settings.png)

- In the **Customized Format** window, search for **List Separator.**

![Image of Customize Format Window](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/customize-format-window.png)

- Check if the **List Separator** is set to **minus (-)**. Change it to **comma (,)**.

![Image of Apply List Seperator In Customize Format Window](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/apply-list-separator-in-customize-format-window.png)

- Click **OK.**
- Now, open the Excel file and again try to use the formula.

## Case 3: Wrong Text Value

The #Value! error can also occur due to the formula’s wrong value.

For example: If you are using the formula to add values in cells and Excel recognizes the unexpected text value, you may get a #Value error.

![Image of #Value! error in Excel because of Wrong Text Value](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/error-with-wrong-text-value.png)

**Solution**

To fix the issue, you can correct the value or use the SUM function. It is recommended to use functions instead of operations to reduce the errors. In Excel, the formulas with math operators may not able to calculate the text in the cells. The SUM function automatically ignores the text value(er), calculates everything as numbers, and displays the result without the #Value! error.

![Image of Highlighting Arguments Of-Sumfunction to fix #Value! error in Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/highlighting-arguments-of-sumfunction.png)

## Case 4: Blank Space in Cells

You may get the #Value! error if your formula refers to other cells with space or hidden space. Sometimes, spaces that make a cell display blank but actually they are not blank.

![Image of #Value! error in Excel because of Blank Space](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/errormessage-with-blank-space.png)

**Solution**

You can either delete the space or replace the blank space. Here’s how:

#### 1\. Delete the Blank Space

First, check if a cell is blank or not. To do this,

- Select the cell that looks blank.
- Press F2.

![Image of Blank cell Not Showing Space and hence the #Value! error in Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/windows-with-blankcell-not-showing-space.png)

The blank cell won’t show space.

Then, press the Backspace key to delete the space. It will fix the error.

![Image of space removed to fix the #Value! error in Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/result-after-deleting-the-space.png)

#### 2\. Replace Blank Space

You can also use the “Find and Select” option to replace the blank space in Excel. Here are the steps:

- Open the Excel file that shows #Value! error.
- On the **Home** tab, click **Find & Select > Replace**.

![Image of Find And Select Option](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/find-and-select-option-1024x159.png)

- In the **Find what** field, type a single space and delete everything in the “Replace with” field.

![Image of Find And Replace Window](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/find-and-replace-window.png)

- Click **Replace All > OK**.

![Image of Result After Replacement With Find-And Select Window](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/result-after-replacement-with-find-and-select-window.png)

## Case 4: Problem with Network Connection

Many users have reported experiencing errors when using Excel online due to problems with the network connection.

**Solution**

Check your Internet connection and see if it is working properly.  

## Case 5: Wrong Formula Format

If you enter the wrong formula with a missing parenthesis or comma, then Excel can throw the #Value! error. The error can also occur if the application finds a special character within a cell.

**Solution**

Correct the formula and use the ISTEXT function to find the cells with issues.  

## Case 6: Corruption in the Excel File

If none of the above works, then it indicates the Excel file is corrupt. The formulas in the Excel file do not work due to corruption.

**Solution**

You can [use the Open and Repair utility](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/repair-a-corrupted-workbook-153a45f4-6cab-44b1-93ca-801ddcd4ea53) in Excel if you are getting the error due to corruption in Excel file.

- Now look for the Excel file that you lost and then double-click on it to open and restore the Excel file.
- Once the file is open, click on **File > Save As** and save it to your desired location.

However, this option works only if you had enabled and set up the ‘_Save AutoRecover information every X minutes_’ option and enabled the ‘_Keep the last AutoRecovered version if I close without saving’_ option.

Also, this may not restore the most recent copy of your Excel file, but it will surely save your time that went into creating and editing the workbook.

### 2\. Repair and Restore Corrupt or Inaccessible Excel File

If the Excel file you are trying to open or access is corrupt, MS Excel will display an error message. When MS Excel detects corruption, it starts ‘File Recovery Mode’ to repair the Excel workbook.

However, if it doesn’t start automatically, you can manually repair minor corruption error and restore the Excel file by following these steps:

- Navigate to **File > Open** and then navigate to the corrupt or damaged Excel file location.
- Select the file and then click on the arrow beside the ‘**Open**’ button to choose the **‘Open and Repair…**’ option.

![open and repair excel file](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/Excel-repair/open-and-repair-excel-file.png)

- Now click ‘**Repair’** if you want to recover maximum data from a corrupt or inaccessible Excel workbook and restore it to a new Excel file.

![repair corrupt excel file](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/Excel-repair/repair-corrupt-excel-sheet.png)

If the ‘**Repair’** option fails, use the Extract Data option that extracts values, data, and formulas from the Excel workbook.

### 3\. Revert Excel File to Last Saved Version

When an Excel file gets corrupt or damaged while working, you may revert the Excel file to the last saved version. This allows you to restore the Excel file version that isn’t corrupt or damaged. The steps are as follows,

- Click File > Open.
- Double-click the name of the workbook that you have opened in Excel.
- Click Yes to reopen the workbook.

The workbook opens without any changes you’ve made that might have caused the workbook to become corrupted.

### 4\. Use Excel Repair Software to Restore Excel File

If the corrupt or damaged Excel file isn’t repaired by using MS Excel options or you lost data after restoring the unsaved version or after reverting to the last version, you can rely on an Excel repair software, such as Stellar Repair for Excel.

The software repairs Excel files with 100% integrity and restores the Excel data, such as table, Pivot tables, charts, etc., while preserving the workbook properties and formatting. The software is safe as it doesn’t alter or make changes to the original Excel file and saves the repaired data to a new Excel workbook at your desired location.

It supports Excel files (XLS and XLSX), created in MS Excel 2019, 2016, or older versions. It resolves Excel corruption errors, such as Unable to open Excel file, in a few clicks.

To repair a corrupt or inaccessible Excel workbook by using Stellar Repair for Excel software, follow these 3 simple steps,

- Select the corrupt or damaged Excel workbook file (XLS/XLSX).

![stellar repair for excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/Excel-repair/stellar-repair-for-Excel-choose-xls-xlsx-file.png)

- Repair and then preview the Excel workbook.

![repaired excel file](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/Excel-repair/repaired-excel-file.png)

- Save the workbook at default or your desired location.

![save repaired excel file](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/Excel-repair/save-repaired-excel-file.png)

Once saved, you can open and start editing or working on the Excel sheet. Make sure to enable AutoRecovery and AutoSave options to avoid data loss due to corruption.

## Conclusion

In this article, we discussed methods and solutions to restore Excel file when it gets damaged or corrupt due to various issues. Although Excel can help you recover or restore Excel file after corruption, it can resolve only minor corruption errors. Thus, it may fail if the Excel file corruption is severe. In such cases, an Excel repair software, such as Stellar Repair for Excel, comes in handy. It resolves Excel corruption, repairs tables, charts, chart sheets, Pivot table, etc., and restores them to a new Excel sheet with 100% consistency.
