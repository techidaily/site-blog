If the “Microsoft Excel error 0x800A03EC” prevents you from accessing the Excel file data, use the Excel repair file tool mentioned in this post to restore the data with complete integrity.

[![Free Download for Windows](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/free-download-windows.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/ "Free Download for Windows")

The error code 0x800A03EC in MS Excel can occur while exporting or importing Excel sheets to or from another application. It can occur when trying to execute a macro. It usually appears when the Excel application fails to read the queries in the VBA code, especially when using the PasteSpecial method (Range.PasteSpecial method) to paste cell data from the clipboard into an Excel sheet. It can occur if the cell data format is not compatible with the target data.

## **Causes of MS Excel Error Code 0x800A03EC**

The error code 0x800A03EC in Excel can occur in different scenarios. There could be several reasons associated with this error. Some of them are:

- Incompatible data formats.
- Trying to paste an extensive range of cells into a smaller range of cells.
- Add-ins are interrupting the code operation.
- Issue with the VBA code (incorrect or incomplete queries).
- Excel file is corrupted/damaged.
- Corrupted macros.
- Trying to export large-sized Excel file which is more than the Excel’s prescribed limit.
- Outdated Excel version.
- Incompatible cell formats on source and destination (when copying/pasting cell data).
- Missing cell range (forget to specify the range while using PasteSpecial method in the VBA code).
- Trying to save Excel file to incorrect directory.
- File path contains invalid characters.

## **Solutions to Fix MS Excel Error Code 0x800A03EC**

The error 0x800A03EC can appear if your Excel file is incompatible with your Excel application version. You can run the [compatibility checker](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/save-an-excel-workbook-for-compatibility-with-earlier-versions-of-excel-169a0336-965b-4430-8554-4e7b5db79947) to review the compatibility issues in your Excel file. If this is not the issue, then follow the below methods.

### Method 1: Review VBA Code

The exception from hresult 0x800a03ec excel can occur if you are trying to execute incorrect or incomplete queries in the Excel VBA code. It can also appear if the formulas do not contain the equal (=) symbol at the beginning. Verify the VBA code for any logical flaws, typo errors, syntax errors, or missing references.

### Method 2: Check the Field Size

Excel has certain [limits and specifications](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/excel-specifications-and-limits-1672b34d-7043-467e-8e27-269d656771c3?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us). If the Excel file’s data exceeds these designated size limits, you can get the MS Excel error code 0x800A03EC error. For example, this error occurs if you try to export a file with more rows than the limit of 65536 and columns than the limit of 256. Check and optimize the file size by minimizing complex formulas and other objects.

### Method 3: Check Add-ins for Disabled Items

Sometimes, disabled items in Add-ins settings can prevent macros from functioning correctly. You can check and enable the disabled items in Add-ins using these steps:

- Navigate to **File > Options**.

![Go To Options Tab](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/go-to-options-tab.jpg)

- In **Excel Options**, click on the **Add-ins** option.
- Click the arrow corresponding to the **Manage** section.
- Select **Disabled Items** and click on the **Go** option.

![Go To Addins And Select Disabled Items](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/go-to-addins-and-select-disabled-items.jpg)

- You will see a list of disabled items.
- Click on the disabled items and then click **Enable**.
- Restart Excel for the applied changes to take effect.

### Method 4: Change Macro Settings

The error code 0x800A03EC can also occur if macros are disabled in the Macro Security settings. Follow these steps to change the macro settings in Excel:

- In MS Excel, go to **File > Options > Trust Center**.

![Click Trust Center Option](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/click-trust-center-option.jpg)

- Under Trust Center, click on **Macro Settings**.

![Click Macro Settings and Selecting Enable All Macros](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/click-macro-settings-select-enable-all-macros.jpg)

- Select **Enable all macros** and click **OK**.

### Method 5: Check the OLE Objects

The Microsoft Excel error code 0x800A03EC can also appear if there is a connection disruption in the VBA. Such an issue can occur if there is an issue with Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) in an Excel workbook. The OLE objects are linked to external files. You can check and remove the unnecessary OLE objects from your Excel file to fix the issue.

### Method 6: Check Methods in VBA

Excel can throw the “Exception from HRESULT: 0x800A03EC” error if you are trying to call an invalid method in a VBA code. Many users have reported this issue when trying to use ‘copy and paste’ feature using copy paste special [method](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/excel.range.pastespecial) (range.pastespecial) in Excel. Paste special is an advanced option in Excel to smooth the copy-and-paste task. While using this method, the exception can usually occur when Excel application detects an invalid or misaligned range or mismatch data type in the syntax. To fix this, check the syntax of the paste special method.

### Method 7: Repair your Excel File

Corruption in Excel file can create inconsistencies in the macro and lead to the “Exception from HRESULT 0x800a03ec Excel” error. In such a case, you can try repairing the Excel file using Microsoft’s inbuilt utility – Open and Repair. To use this utility, follow these steps:

- In the Excel application, go to the **File** tab and then click **Open**.

- Click on the **Repair** button to recover as much of the data as possible.
- After repair, a message is displayed. Click Close.

[![Free Download for Windows](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/free-download-windows.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/ "Free Download for Windows")

Similar to any other program, you may experience problems with Microsoft Excel while opening or working on a document. Sometimes, it may not start at all or freeze and display an error message such as ‘Excel is not responding’. When it happens, you may want to wait for the program to respond.

![Microsoft Excel is not Responding ](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Microsoft-Excel-not-responding.png)

‘Microsoft Excel is not responding’ problem

**Tip:** If you are experiencing Excel not responding problem with a particular Excel file, it’s quite possible that the file is corrupt or partially damaged. And thus, leading to an Excel freeze or crash problem. Use Stellar Repair for Excel software to quickly repair and restore Excel (.xls/.xlsx) file in its original, intact form. You can download the free trial version of the software from the below link.

But if Excel doesn’t respond after a while and remains stuck, you need to force close the program from “**Task Manager**”. Now, this could be disastrous if happens while you are working on an important Excel document that took you hours to prepare. Force closing Excel due to such error can damage the Excel document and it may fail to open next time.

## **Why Excel is Not Responding?**

Excel may stop responding, freeze, or crash suddenly due to several reasons. It can happen while saving a spreadsheet or opening an Excel document. It may also occur while editing or inserting images, graphs, etc. But usually, it occurs when the system crashes or shuts down abruptly while you are working on a document. Here’s an instance,

_Suppose, you worked overnight on a critical document which is to be presented at a meeting the next day. This Excel spreadsheet includes critical graphs and charts, and much more. When you are about to save it, there is a power failure, and your system shuts down without warning. When the power is up, you restarted the system to check your Excel. To your dismay, a message pops up – “Excel Crashed” or “Microsoft Excel not responding”._

This could be frustrating. However, there is no need to despair as there are solutions to not just overcome this error but other corresponding issues such as Excel freezing, hanging, crashing, etc. Below is an infographic that quickly briefs all the possible solutions to fix Excel not responding error.

## **Solutions to Fix ‘Microsoft Excel is not responding’ Error**

Follow the solutions discussed below in the given order to fix Excel freezing and hanging issues.

### **Solution 1**: **Open Excel in Safe Mode**

If Excel is not working as intended and frequently stops responding, you may try to start Excel in Safe Mode. It is a common DIY way to fix ‘Excel is not responding’ problem.

In Safe Mode, Excel starts with only essential services, bypasses certain functionalities and doesn’t load the add-ins, which might be the reason behind the error in MS Excel . To open and troubleshoot Excel in **Safe Mode**:

- Press **Windows + R** keys, type **excel.exe /safe and press ‘Enter’ or click ‘OK’**

![MS Excel in Safe Mode](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Excel-safe-mode-1024x523.png)

MS Excel in Safe Mode

Open the Excel file and check if it still crashes. If not, the problem could be a faulty add-in or formatting and styling error.

Proceed to the next solution to check and fix the problem.

### **Solution 2: Check for Faulty and Unwanted Add-ins**

**In Microsoft Excel, there are two types of add-ins:**

- **COM add-ins**
- **Other Add-ins Installed as XLAM, XLA, or XLL File**

**Both types of add-ins can cause the freezing problem in Excel . Follow the steps below to disable unwanted and faulty add-ins:**

- In Excel , click **File and g**o to **Options** to open ‘**Excel Options**’ window
- Click **Add-ins** button to view and manage ‘**Microsoft Office Add-ins**’
- Uncheck required add-ins to disable them
- At this stage, you can also click the ‘**Remove**’ button to remove any unwanted add-ins

![Disable COM Add-Ins](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Remove-COM-Addins.jpg)

Disable COM Add-Ins

- Now enable an add-in and check the Excel performance. Observe Excel for not responding error or freezing problem

If Excel doesn’t freeze, enable subsequent add-in and then again use Excel to observe it. Repeat the steps until you find the faulty plugin, which is causing the problem.

Then remove it from Excel add-ins to resolve the problem.

### **Solution 3****:** **Install the latest Windows and Office Updates**

This problem may also occur if Windows and MS Office are not updated. Therefore, install the latest updates for both Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office.

You can set the installation and update option to ‘**Automatic mode**’ in Windows. This will download and install critical updates for MS Office, which might fix the Excel performance issue. The steps to enable automatic updates are as follows:

1. Go to **Settings> Update & Security> Windows Update**

![Enable Automatic Windows updates](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/update-windows-1024x796.jpg)

Enable Automatic Windows updates

- Click **Advanced options** and enable all the toggle switches to automatically download and install updates for Windows and other Microsoft products

![Update Microsoft Products](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/upload-WIndows-Products-1024x796.jpg)

Update Microsoft Products

After update, restart Excel and check if the problem is resolved.

**_NOTE:_** _From now on, MS Excel will also get the latest update consistently, without the need for manual intervention._

### **Solution 4:  Check and Disable Anti-virus**

Antivirus is important for device safety. However, if your antivirus conflicts with MS Office apps such as Excel, it could lead to Excel freezing and not responding errors.

To check if the problem is due to anti-virus, disable it and reopen the Excel document. Check if Excel performs well or if it still hangs.

![Example of Antivirus conflict with Microsoft Excel](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Antivirus.jpg)

Example of Antivirus conflict with Microsoft Excel

If the problem is resolved, contact your antivirus software provider for help to keep antivirus running without affecting the system and other programs such as MS Excel.

### **Solution 5: Change the ‘Default Printer’**

Although it may seem irrelevant, changing the default printer is another easy and effective solution to overcome the error. Reason being, Excel communicates with the printer to find supported margins when we open an Excel sheet.

If Excel doesn’t find the supported margin, it may stop responding or crash. The steps to change the default printer are as follows:

1. Open **Control Panel** on your Windows system
2. Click **Printer and Devices**
3. Right-click **Microsoft XPS Document Writer** to set it to the default printer

![Change in Default Printer Setting](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Default-Printer-Setting-1.jpg)

Change in Default Printer Setting

Reopen the Excel document to check whether the error occurs or not.

### **Solution 6: Repair Microsoft Office**

A corrupt or damaged Microsoft Office can also cause the ‘Excel is not responding’ problem. You can resolve this by repairing the Microsoft Office files. The steps are as follows:

1. **Close** all running MS Office programs
2. Go to **Control Panel** on your Windows system
3. Click **Programs** and then **Programs** **and** **Features**
4. Select **Microsoft Office** and in the Microsoft Office window, click ‘**Change**’
5. Then select the ‘**Repair**’ option and click ‘**Continue**’

![Repair MS Office](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Repair-MS-Office.jpg)

Repair MS Office

This may take a while. After the repair is done, check your Excel program and file for the error.

### **Solution 7: Remove and Reinstall Microsoft Office**

Sometimes, repairing MS Office may not work. In such a case, removing and reinstalling Microsoft Office can resolve the ‘Excel is not responding’ problem. To do so, follow these steps:

1. **Close** all running MS Office programs
2. Go to **Control Panel** on your Windows system
3. Click **Programs** and then **Programs** **and** **Features**
4. Right-click on **Microsoft Office** and choose **Uninstall**

![ Uninstall MS Office](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Uninstall-MS-Office.jpg)

Uninstall MS Office

Then run the MS Office installation setup to re-install MS Office on your system.

## Repair Office 2016 Files (Word, Excel and PowerPoint)on Windows

If you frequently work with Microsoft Word (.docx), Excel (.xlsx), and PowerPoint (.pptx) files, then issues like file inaccessibility or corruption won’t be new to you.

Let’s discuss some common scenarios which may lead to corrupt MS Office 2016 files:  

## Scenarios behind Microsoft Office Files Corruption

### Scenario 1 – Disruption during Data Migration

You decide to move Office files from your hard drive to other removable media. However, when you try to access the data within the files post-migration, you may find Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files showing gibberish characters. Due to a power surge, sudden system shutdown, and internal mechanical failure, the files may have turned corrupt.

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/article/word/Word-displaying-gibberish-characters.png)

Figure 1- Microsoft Word file showing garbage characters

### Scenario 2 – Office Files and Registry Entries Become Infected

When you open or use the Microsoft Office application, it crashes as soon as it opens. You assume that an add-in was causing the problem and restart the Office application without add-ins loaded, but the application still crashes. This may happen because of a virus infecting the Office files and registry values, thus leading to corrupt or damaged Office files.

### **Scenario 3 – Inaccessible or Lost Data**

Suppose all your Office files are stored on a USB device, and you unplugged the device while it was still open in Windows. Now, when you attempt to open a Word or an Excel file, all the data is gone. Unsafe removal of USB or any other external storage device may corrupt the data inside your Office files or turn the file inaccessible.

## How Can You Deal with Microsoft Office Files Corruption?

Here are a few solutions that can help you fix or repair Office 2016 Files Corruption:

### Solution 1 – Use Microsoft in-built Repair Utility

Microsoft recommends using its in-built repair utility, 'Open and Repair', to fix corrupt Office files. Follow these steps to understand how you can use the utility to repair the corrupt Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files:

- Launch the MS Office application whose file you want to repair:

1. To repair corrupt Word (.doc, .docx) files, launch MS Word
2. To repair corrupt Excel files (.xls, .xlsx) files, launch MS Excel
3. To repair corrupt PowerPoint (.ppt, .pptx) files, launch MS PowerPoint

- Click File, and then click the Open tab.
- Click Navigate to the location or folder where the Word, Excel, or PowerPoint file is stored.

**_Note_**_: If these options are already selected, then unselect and re-select them._

### **Method 2: Enable Sharing Wizard Option**

- Go to your system’s **Documents** folder.
- Click **View > Options > Change folders** **and search options.**

![Click View Option In Documents](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/click-view-option-in-documents.jpg)

### **Method 3: Move the Excel File to a Trusted Location**

![Type Safe Mode Command In Excel](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/type-safe-mode-command-in-excel.jpg)

- Type **excel /safe** and click on **OK**.
