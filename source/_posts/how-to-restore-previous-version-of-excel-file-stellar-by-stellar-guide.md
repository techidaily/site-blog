## Get Rid of corrupt Excel File

**Summary:** What to do when an Excel file is corrupted? This is a common question that is often asked by Microsoft Excel users. If you too are seeking an answer to this question, read the blog to learn about a few manual workarounds and a specialized Excel file repair tool to resolve the Excel file corruption issue.

[![Free Download for Windows](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/free-download-windows.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/ "Free Download for Windows")

An Excel file gets corrupted due to various reasons such as a virus/malware attack, sudden system shutdown when the Excel file is still open, power failure while working with an Excel spreadsheet, etc.

When Microsoft Excel detects corruption in a workbook, it attempts to repair the workbook by starting _‘File Recovery mode’._

**Tip!** If the file recovery mode doesn’t start, you may use the manual repair process or an Excel repair tool, such as Stellar Repair for Excel to repair a corrupted Excel file. The software can help you quickly retrieve contents from a damaged, corrupt, or inaccessible Excel file and restore the file to its original state.

There even exist a few manual tips that can be used to recover data from damaged MS Office Excel files.

## **Workarounds to Use When an Excel File is Corrupted**

**_Note:_** _Before carrying out any of the repair and recovery workarounds, it is advised that you must save a backup copy of the damaged file. This is to prevent your files from turning completely inaccessible in case the methods fail to give desired results._

### **Workaround 1: Use the Open and Repair Method**

If MS Excel cannot repair a corrupted workbook automatically, you can try to do it manually. To do so, perform the following:

- Open the corrupt file, like you normally open any file, by clicking **File** > **Open**.
- Browse and locate the folder containing the corrupted document.
- When the Open dialog box is displayed:
- Select the Excel document.
- Click on the arrow present to the right side of the Open button and select **Open and Repair** option.

Figure 1 – Open and Repair Feature

If this doesn’t help repair the broken Excel file or you encounter  [Open and Repair does not work](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/) issue, proceed with the next workaround.

**_Tip!_** _Try an alternative solution, i.e._ **_Stellar Repair for Excel software_** _to repair and recover corrupt Excel files (.xlsx or .xls) when the ‘Open and Repair’ method won’t work._  

### **Workaround 2: Restore an Excel File with a Shadow Copy**

If you’re a **Windows 7 or Vista user,** you can try restoring the corrupted spreadsheet by using a shadow copy (or a previous version). [Shadow copy](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_Copy#:~:text=Shadow%20Copy%20(also%20known%20as,the%20Volume%20Shadow%20Copy%20service>.) is basically a snapshot (backup copy) of computer files or volumes. The snapshot may contain an older version of your Excel file that has become damaged now. To find out, do the following:

- **Launch File Explorer**, and right-click the folder in which the **file is saved.**
- Choose **Properties.**
- Look for and click the **Previous Versions** tab. This will display a list of entries under **Folder versions** or **File versions**, going back a few days or weeks.
- Double-click one with a date when the file was accessible and could be read. Then, try to open its older version. If it opens, save the older version with a new name and execute the procedure with new file/folder entries.

![Excel file is corrupted](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Shadow-copy.png)

Figure 2 – Volume Shadow Copy

You would have to repeat the process until you reach the point where the file became damaged. With this, you will get a baseline version of the file, but data may still have been lost.

### **Workaround 3: Test your Assumptions**

If you receive a message saying “[**Excel file corrupted and cannot be opened**](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/)”, you would probably believe it. However, there could be other reasons besides corruption that may cause Excel to throw this error message.

Your Office suite, which Excel is a part of, maybe having some primary issues in it causing problems while opening one Excel document. So, try opening another Excel file to check if the problem exists with all the files or just one.

If other Excel documents work correctly, it means that only the particular document is corrupt. On the contrary, if the issue is with your Office suite, repairing the current Office installation may help fix the issue. For this, perform these steps:

- Go to **Control Panel and click Uninstall** **the Program**.
- Choose **Office.**
- Click Change, and hit the **Repair button.**

You can **reinstall** the entire Office package. Once reinstalled, try to open the file to check if the issue has been fixed and the **Excel file repaired.**

You can follow the given steps to recover unsaved Excel files with the AutoRecover feature:

- Open a new Excel file and go to **File > Options**.
- Then go to **Save > Save** **workbooks**.
- Next, ensure that the ‘**Save AutoRecover information every’** and ‘**Keep the last autosaved version if I close without saving**’ option is already selected.

## **FAQ**

**1. How can I repair a corrupted workbook?**

Whenever Excel detects a corrupted workbook while opening, it automatically starts running the File Recovery mode and repairing the file. If the File Recovery mode doesn’t start automatically, you can manually [repair the corrupted workbook](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/repair-a-corrupted-workbook-153a45f4-6cab-44b1-93ca-801ddcd4ea53).


## How to fix runtime error 424 object required error in Excel

The Runtime error 424: Object required occurs when Excel is not able to recognize an object that you are referring to in a VBA code. The object can be a workbook, worksheet, range, variable, class, macro, etc. Some users have also reported that this error occurred when they tried to copy the values of the cells from one workbook to another.

Let’s understand the error through a small scenario. Suppose, I want to check the last field row in a table in a spreadsheet named “First” using the VBA code. To do this, I have added a command button and double-clicked on it and entered the below code in the backend:

Private Sub CommandButton2\_Click()

Dim LRow As Integer

LRow = Worksheets("First").Cells(Rows.Count, 2).End(xlUp).Row

MsgBox ("Last Row " & LRow)

End Sub

![Code On Command Button](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/Error424/code-on-commandbutton.jpg)

In this code, _Worksheets("First")_ is a data object. If I mistakenly delete this data object and insert any random name (for example - kanada), then it will not be recognized by Excel. When I run this code, I will get the “Run-time error 424”.

![Runtime Error with scenario](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/Error424/run-time-error-424-with-scenario.jpg)

## **Causes of Runtime Error 424 in Excel**

The Runtime error 424: Object required can occur due to the following reasons:

- Incorrect name of the object you are trying to refer to in a code.
- You have provided an invalid qualifier to an object.
- You have not used the Set statement while assigning an object reference.
- The object is corrupted.
- Missing objects in a workbook.
- Objects you are trying to call in a code are mistakenly deleted or unavailable.
- You have used an incorrect syntax for object declaration.
- You are trying to perform an invalid action on an object in a code.
- Workbook is corrupted.

##  **Solutions to Fix Runtime Error 424: Object Required in Excel**

The VBA error ‘object required’ may occur due to different reasons. Based on the reason, you can follow the solutions mentioned below to fix the error.

### **1\. Check the Name of the Object**

The Runtime error 424 can occur when you run the VBA code using an incorrect name of the object. For example, the object name is ‘MyObject’ but you’re using “Backcolor”.

![Error When Incorrect Name Of The Object](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/Error424/error-424-when-incorrect-name-of-the-object.jpg)

![Highlighting Line With Error](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/Error424/highlighting-line-with-error.jpg)

To fix the issue, you need to provide the correct name of the object.

### **2\. Check if the Object is Missing**

 The Runtime error 424 can occur if the object you are referring to as a method is not available or you are using the wrong object in a code. In the below example, you can see that the error occurs when an object named “Employee” is not available in the Project list.

![Example Of Code When Object Is Not Available](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/Error424/example-of-code-when-an-object-is-not-available.jpg)
