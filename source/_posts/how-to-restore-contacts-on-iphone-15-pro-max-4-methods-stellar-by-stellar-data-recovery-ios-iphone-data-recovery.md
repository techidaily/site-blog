## How to Restore Contacts on iPhone (4 Methods)

**Summary:** Many of the users have been wondering about the ways to restore deleted contacts. In this post, we shared the best methods to restore deleted contacts from your iPhone series 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, XS, XS Max, XR, X, 8, 7, 6, and 5.

 [![Free Download for Windows](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/free-download-windows.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/data-recovery-ios/ "Free Download for Windows")[![Free Download for Mac](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/free-download-Mac.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/data-recovery-ios/ "Free Download for Mac")

Losing contact names and numbers from the device all of a sudden is not new for iPhone users. Sometimes contact names are missing with only the random numbers visible, or the contact list is altogether empty. Mostly, the incidents occur after updating to a newer version of iOS, a bug in the device, accidental deletion, or else formatting of the iPhone.

You can always restore from iCloud or iTunes backup, but sometimes even those attempts might fail to recover deleted contacts. This can be because of wrong user names, passcodes, or device settings.

In such cases, the best way to restore only the missing contacts is to use **iPhone Data Recovery Software** by Stellar**.** Read on to know the four solutions to recover deleted contact on iPhone below.

If you have synced your iPhone to iCloud backup, restore missing contact names and numbers with this method.

- Go to your iPhone **Settings > iCloud > Contacts** (iOS 16 & 15 users follow: Settings > User Name > iCloud)

- Toggle OFF and turn ON **Contacts** again

![recover deleted contacts from iCloud](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-8b4e845/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2-1.png)

- It asks what you would like to do with the previously synced iCloud contacts on your iPhone. Select **Delete from My iPhone**.

You will get back lost contacts on the iPhone. Those accounts are also displayed in your group lists if you have different Cloud accounts like Gmail linked to your device. You can check and uncheck the group to view or hide, respectively.

This works only when you have backed up your iPhone to iTunes.

- Connect your iPhone to the PC
-  Launch iTunes
- Select your device from the Device list and pick the most recent backup entry date of your iPhone from the Summary page

![how to restore contacts on iPhone from iTunes Backup](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-8b4e845/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/iphone-backup.png)

- Click **Restore Backup**

You can get back the lost or deleted contacts from your iTunes backup. But the drawback of this method is that with iTunes, you do not have a choice to restore only the lost contacts on your iPhone selectively. This means that complete data from iTunes will be restored on your device, replacing existing iPhone data.

All current media photos, videos, messages, etc., on your iPhone will also be replaced by the iOS backup files. If you want to restore only contacts from iTunes backup, use a safe third-party iPhone data recovery application.

The best way to overcome the iTunes drawback and selectively restore only the missing contacts is to use [iPhone Contact Recovery](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/data-recovery-ios/) Software by Stellar.
