## Part 2: How to transfer music from Itel S23 to iPhone selectively?

Another user-friendly way to learn how to send music from Itel S23 to iPhone is by using [Dr.Fone - Phone Manager (Android)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-transfer.html). A part of the Dr.Fone toolkit, it can be a complete Android device manager. You can transfer your data between Android and computer and from an Android to an iOS device. You can even move songs from your Itel S23 to iTunes without using iTunes itself.

Since it is a complete Android phone manager, you can use it to transfer all the other kinds of data (like photos, videos, contacts, messages, and more) from one source to another. Unlike Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer that moves all the music files at once, you can perform a selective data transfer. The interface will provide a preview of your data so that you can choose the files you wish to move. To learn how to transfer music from Itel S23 to iPhone selectively, follow these steps:

1. Install and open the Dr.Fone toolkit on your computer and click on the “Phone Manager” option from the home screen.

    ![how to transfer music from android to iphone-click on transfer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

2. Connect both Android phones and iPhone to software and let them be detected automatically. From the top-left option, make sure you have selected your Itel S23 as a default/source device. The interface will provide its snapshot with some shortcuts.

    ![how to transfer music from android to iphone-select your Itel S23 as a source device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/transfer-files-quickly-to-android-1.png)

3. To manage the music files stored on the Android device, go to the “Music” tab on the interface. Here, you can view all music files, podcasts, audiobooks, songs, etc., listed in different categories.
4. Choose the files and then select the export button on the toolbar. From here, select the connected iPhone as a source.

    ![how to transfer music from android to iphone-click on the export icon](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/drfone/android-transfer-export-music-01.jpg)

5. Wait a moment and let the application automatically transfer your selected music files from your Itel S23 to your iPhone.

    Besides performing a direct transfer of data from one smartphone to another, you can also use the application to transfer music from Itel S23 to iTunes as well. To do this, you need to select the “Transfer Device Media to iTunes” option from its home page. This will launch a pop-up window and let you move your music files from the Android device to iTunes directly.

    ![how to transfer music from android to iphone-Transfer Device Media to iTunes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/drfone/mac-android-transfer-to-itunes-01.jpg)

In this way, you can selectively transfer music from Itel S23 to iPhone in a hassle-free manner.

## Part 3: How to transfer music from Itel S23 to iPhone using Android File Transfer?

If you use a Mac, then you can use Android File Transfer to move your data from your Itel S23 to your system. Though, to transfer music from Itel S23 to iPhone, you would later need to take the assistance of iTunes. This is because you can’t simply drag and drop your data from your system to the iPhone. While the solution is free, it is certainly quite complicated and is not direct like Dr.Fone.

1. To start with, download and install Android File Transfer from its official [website](https://www.android.com/filetransfer/) on your Mac. It is compatible with macOS 10.7 and higher versions.
2. Now, connect your Itel S23 to your Mac and launch Android File Transfer (if it won’t automatically launch already).
3. Go to the Music folder, copy your favorite songs, and save them to your Mac. After that, you can transfer music from your Itel S23 to your Mac.

    ![how to transfer music from android to iPhone-Go to the Music folder](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-music-from-android-to-iphone-1.jpg)

4. Great! You are halfway there. Launch iTunes on your Mac and add the newly transferred music to it. You can drag and drop it from the Finder to iTunes. Alternatively, you can also go to its options and click on “Add files to Library”. In this way, you can manually add new music to your iTunes library.

    ![how to transfer music from android to iphone-Add files to Library](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-music-from-android-to-iphone-2.jpg)

5. Once you have transferred the newly added music to iTunes, connect your target iPhone to the system, and let iTunes detect it automatically.
6. Select your iPhone from the Itel S23 devices and go to its “Music” tab. From here, you can enable the “Sync Music” options. Select the playlists and songs you wish to move and click on the “Apply” button to initiate the process.

    ![how to transfer music from android to iphone-Select the playlists and songs](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-music-from-android-to-iphone-3.jpg)

To avoid all this unwanted hassle, you can simply take Dr.Fone applications' assistance and transfer music from Itel S23 to iPhone effortlessly. In this way, you can learn how to send music from Itel S23 to iPhone through iTunes and Android File Transfer.

## Part 4: How to transfer streaming music from Itel S23 to iPhone?

These days, many people use streaming services like Apple Music, Google Play Music, Spotify, etc., to listen to their favorite songs without the hassle of downloading them. The good thing about these streaming services is that you can access your music from multiple devices. For instance, let’s consider the example of Spotify.

Once you have created a playlist on your Spotify account, you can access it from any other device. You can even access your music by visiting its website because it will be stored on Spotify’s server and not your device itself.

![how to transfer music from android to iphone-transfer streaming music](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-music-from-android-to-iphone-4.jpg)

If you are moving from an Android to an iPhone, you can follow these steps to ensure your Spotify music won’t be lost.

- Launch Spotify on your Itel S23 and go to the Playlist tab. From here, you can create a playlist. Later, you can add your favorite songs to this playlist as well. You can even create multiple playlists on the app.

![how to transfer music from android to iphone-create a playlist](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-music-from-android-to-iphone-5.jpg)

- Afterward, unlock your iPhone and go to the App store. Look for the music streaming app and download it on your phone.
- Once you log in to your Spotify account using your credentials, you can access “My Music” and access all your saved playlists.

![how to transfer music from android to iphone-access all your saved playlists](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-music-from-android-to-iphone-6.jpg)

The same drill can be followed for all the other streaming services as well. While you can sync your music using these streaming services, the songs you have made available offline will not be listed here. Therefore, you need to make sure that you have saved them in a playlist beforehand.

When you know how to move music from Itel S23 to iPhone, you can easily make this transition. Go ahead and pick a preferred option to transfer music from Itel S23 to iPhone. For a one-click transfer of data, you can use [Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/phone-switch/), while to make a selective transfer, you can try [Dr.Fone - Phone Manager (Android)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-transfer.html). Both of these are user-friendly and reliable tools that will come handy to you on numerous occasions.

Restarting your devices is the essential thing to do when troubleshooting the Move to iOS problems. It is a great way o eliminate minor issues during data transfer from android to iOS devices. The process can resolve the Move to iOS stuck on connecting to iPhone issues. A simple restart will eliminate the bugs and any cached error in the Itel S23 devices.

### Tip 2: Clear all running apps

It is recommended to avoid using the android device o run applications when using the Move to iOS app. Since the app runs in the foreground, you should ensure all other apps in the android are disabled before starting the data transfer process. Notifications and incoming calls are likely to interfere with the process; therefore, users must ensure such distraction is not happening by disabling such apps.

### Tip 3: Make sure the Wi-Fi connection is turned on

Wi-Fi connectivity is a significant factor in ensuring data transfer is successful. Since Move to iOS relies on Wi-Fi, you should ensure it Is turned on and is stable. The iPhone usually creates a private network for the android device to connect. Please turn on the Wi-Fi connection on your android to make it ready to connect to the iPhone's private network. This will make it possible to send the Move to iOS code to initiate the data transfer process.

### Tip 4: Plug both devices to power

You should ensure that both the android and iOS devices have sufficient power to run through the entire data transfer process. If you doubt the power consumption, keep the Itel S23 devices connected to power before you start moving your content from android to iOS device.

### Tip 5: Set your phone into airplane mode

When you transfer android data to iOS using the Move to iOS tool, apple recommends that you turn off your mobile data. Some android devices can switch from Wi-Fi to mobile data when the connection tends to drop on either side using the smart switch feature. This can interfere with the transfer process. Similarly, it could be useful if incoming calls were prevented to avoid interfering with the data transfer process. All mediums of connectivity are disabled except for the connection between the android and iOS devices through the iPhones Wi-Fi network.

The best way to ensure these distractions are not happening is to turn on airplane mode on the android device.

### Tip 6: Check the storage requirement

Before you begin transferring android data to iOS devices, check the size of all content including the external micro SD card, to determine whether it fits into the new iOS device. If the content is larger than the destination storage, you will obviously encounter an error during the transfer process. You need to delete the content you don't need to transfer from your android device before getting started.

### Tip 7: Disable the connection optimizer

Android devices with connection optimizers will switch between different connections for better connectivity. Since the Move to iOS app utilizes the iPhones private network, the connection optimizer might start using mobile data or switch to another Wi-Fi connection when the current connection drops. The circumstance can break the connection between the android ad iOS device hence interfering with the data transfer process. Be sure to turn off the feature from settings before running the Move to iOS app.

### Tip 8: Check the compatibility of your devices

You need to check whether your android device meets the minimum requirements to be compatible with the Move to iOS app, much like other apps found on the App Store and Google play store. Generally, the app runs on Android 4.0 and above while transferring data to iOS 9.0 or later devices.

### Tip 9: Turn off battery optimization

Turning off the battery optimization on both your Android and iOS device is a requirement when using the Move to iOS tool. The app is designed to run in the foreground, and the android user should not have other applications running. However, the phone might automatically minimize the Move to iOS app when it switches to battery optimization mode. Therefore you should ensure the feature is closed from the settings of your android device.
