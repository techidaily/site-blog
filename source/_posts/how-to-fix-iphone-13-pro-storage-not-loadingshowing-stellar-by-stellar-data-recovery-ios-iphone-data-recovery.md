After the Update process completes, you can restore your iPhone from iTunes or iCloud backup without facing the error 1015.

**Note:** If you are unable to enter Recovery Mode on your iPhone due to jailbreak, you may use programs like RecBoot, which are used to enter and exit the Recovery Mode on iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.

### **6\. Delete the IPSW file on your computer**

Files with _.ipsw_ extensions on your computer are backups and temporary files of your iOS updates. Many iPhone users who were receiving error 1015 while restoring iPhone were able to fix the problem by deleting these files on their PC or Mac.

Deleting these backup files doesn’t impact your iTunes or iPhone function.

**Note:** You can get rid of the old IPSW files and keep the most recent ones.

**<u>Location of .IPSW files on your computer:</u>**

**On Windows XP:** C:\\Documents and Settings\\\[username\]\\Application Data\\Apple Computer\\iTunes\\iPhone Software Update

**On Windows Vista/7:** C:\\Users\\\[username\]\\AppData\\Roaming\\Apple Computer\\iTunes\\iPhone Software Updates

**On Mac OS X:** ~/Library/iTunes/iPhone Software Updates

### **7\. Restore your iPhone into DFU Mode**

When no other method is helpful, choose to put your iPhone in DFU (Device Firmware Update) mode. Whether you are receiving the iPhone error 1015 due to jailbreaking your iOS device or not, the DFU mode solution is your last resort to fix error 1015.

As in Recovery Mode, bringing your iOS device to DFU mode will lead to loss of iPhone data. Thus, before you attempt this, make sure you have iCloud or iTunes backup.

**Steps to DFU mode for iPhone 7, 6s and below users:**

- Connect your iPhone to computer (even if your iPhone is off)
- For 8 seconds, press and hold the Sleep button and Home button (iPhone 6s and below users) or the volume down button (iPhone 7). Next, release the Sleep button but continue to hold the Home button or the volume down button until iTunes shows message _‘iTunes has detected an iPhone in recovery mode._’

- Leave the Home button or volume down button. The iPhone screen turns black indicating the device has entered DFU mode
- Next, you can restore your iPhone using iTunes

**Steps to DFU mode for iPhone X, 8, or 8 Plus users**

- Connect your iPhone to computer (even if your iPhone is off)
- Quickly press and release the volume up button, quickly press and release the volume down button, and press and hold the side button until your iPhone screen turns black
- Press and hold the volume down button while continue holding the side button for 5 seconds
