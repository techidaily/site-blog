## **Wrapping Up**

Users look forward to iOS updates. However, the experience can get irritating, when iPhone software updates fail. For example, iPhone _‘attempting data recovery’_ loop is a common problem faced after attempts to upgrade to the latest iOS 16.

Force restart of the device often resolves the _‘**attempting data recovery**’_ loop issue. If this doesn’t work, further try to get your iPhone on Recovery Mode. Later restore data via iTunes or **Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone**. The software approach is straightforward and lets you select and restore the informathat you want.
