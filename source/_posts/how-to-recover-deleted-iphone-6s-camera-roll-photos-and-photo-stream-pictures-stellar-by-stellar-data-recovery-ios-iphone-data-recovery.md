Further, if you enter the wrong password six times, then a message is displayed stating that the iPhone has been disabled.

![forgot-iphone-password-best-solutions](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/1-2.jpg)_Figure 1. If you enter the wrong password six times in a row, then a message will be displayed stating that your iPhone has been disabled._

## Forgot iPhone passcode? What to do next?

Alright, I know it’s next to impossible that you will ever forget your passcode but we cannot overlook the fact that, yes there is a chance that you may forget it. The majority of us will say that we use fingerprint identity sensor (Touch ID) and hardly use a numeric passcode. Well, suppose your Touch ID stops working properly and to fix it you need to go to **Settings < Touch ID & Passcode < Enter the Passcode.**

Wait! What! You need to enter the passcode to get the Touch ID working again and you thought that you’d never need to remember the passcode. If you have a backup of your data, then all you have to do is simply reset your iPhone and restore your data from the backup. Unfortunately, you’ll only restore data that has been backed up and any new data added after that won’t be there. That said, let’s delve into some of the best solutions for forgotten iPhone password.  
If you’ve forgotten the password, these options will help you out:

- Erase your iOS device with iTunes to remove the password
- Erase the passcode with iCloud
- Use Recovery mode if you’re unable to connect to either iCloud or iTunes
- Leverage an iPhone data recovery to recover deleted/lost data

## Erase your iPhone with iTunes, restore files from it and remove the passcode

i. Connect your iPhone to your computer and launch iTunes  
ii. If you’re asked for the passcode, try another computer with which you’ve synced your iPhone, else proceed with either iCloud or Recovery mode  
iii. Sync your iPhone with iTunes and make a backup of it  
iv. On your iPhone set up the screen, choose Restore from iTunes backup  
v. In iTunes select your iPhone and select the relevant backup
