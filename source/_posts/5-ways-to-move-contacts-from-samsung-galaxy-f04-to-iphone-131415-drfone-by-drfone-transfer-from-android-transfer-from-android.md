And also, it is impossible to transfer apps from Samsung Galaxy F04 to BlackBerry because of different operating systems. Sometimes, not even all photos, videos and music files will be compatible. But, luckily, the BlackBerry developers have thought of a one way, which is simpler than the manual transfer mentioned above, to transfer your data from Samsung Galaxy F04 to BlackBerry. It takes less time, but you still need to do some work.

## Part 2: How to transfer data from Samsung Galaxy F04 to Blackberry (Free)

The BlackBerry developers have thought of an app that will help you transfer your contacts, calendar videos and photos from and Android device to a BlackBerry. You will not need to connect the Samsung Galaxy F04 devices to a PC or Mac. You will only need to connect both devices to the same Wi-Fi network. The app is called Device Switch.

From the Home screen of your BlackBerry tap the ‘BlackBerry World’.
