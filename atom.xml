Here, the Moto G4 Play was tapped on OnePlus Nord 2:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/01/transfer-contacts-android-to-android-2.jpg"                      alt="initiate pairing process on either device"                ></p><p>Step 5: A prompt to pair with the new phone will come on the other device as well. For your device, make sure that the PIN is the same on both devices to ensure the security of the connection. This PIN is generated afresh and is unique, so the PIN in the image is not the PIN you will see on your devices. Tap Pair on your old device to pair the two devices together using Bluetooth.</p><p>Step 6: After pairing is complete, both devices will show under paired devices on each other:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/01/transfer-contacts-android-to-android-3.jpg"                      alt="old device showing paired android"                ></p><p>And that’s how simple it is to pair devices to each other using Bluetooth!</p><h3 id="I-II-Transfer-Contacts-from-One-Android-Smartphone-to-Another-Using-Bluetooth"><a href="#I-II-Transfer-Contacts-from-One-Android-Smartphone-to-Another-Using-Bluetooth" class="headerlink" title="I.II: Transfer Contacts from One Android Smartphone to Another Using Bluetooth"></a>I.II: Transfer Contacts from One Android Smartphone to Another Using Bluetooth</h3><p>Here is how to transfer contacts from one Android to another, easily, using Bluetooth:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Phone on your old phone and select the Contacts tab</p><p>Step 2: Tap the vertical ellipses and select Import&#x2F; Export.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/01/transfer-contacts-android-to-android-4.jpg"                      alt="export contacts from old android to new"                ></p><p>This particular option can vary by your phone model and Android flavor, this is on Android 7 running on Motorola G4 Play. If you are unable to find a way to select contacts or share contacts in the Phone app on your phone, use the Contacts app on your phone for the same effect.</p><p>Step 3: A popup will emerge:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/01/transfer-contacts-android-to-android-5.jpg"                      alt="select share all contacts to transfer contacts"                ></p><p>Select Share All Contacts.</p><p>Step 4: When you do that, this will come up:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/01/transfer-contacts-android-to-android-6.jpg"                      alt="select bluetooth as the method to share with"                ></p><p>Select Bluetooth in the Share With menu. You may select Always or Just Once and proceed.</p><p>Step 5: Choose the paired handset, in this case, the OnePlus Nord 2:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/01/transfer-contacts-android-to-android-7.jpg"                      alt="select paired device to transfer to"                ></p><p>Step 6: The VCF file will be exported to Nord 2 and you can accept it on the Nord 2 (new device).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/01/transfer-contacts-android-to-android-8.jpg"                      alt="receive contacts on new device"                ></p><p>And that is how to transfer contacts from an Android smartphone to another using Bluetooth!</p><h2 id="Part-II-Other-Methods-to-Transfer-Contacts-from-Oppo-Reno-10-Pro-5G-to-Other-Android-Devices"><a href="#Part-II-Other-Methods-to-Transfer-Contacts-from-Oppo-Reno-10-Pro-5G-to-Other-Android-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Part II: Other Methods to Transfer Contacts from Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G to Other Android Devices"></a>Part II: Other Methods to Transfer Contacts from Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G to Other Android Devices</h2><p>What are other ways to transfer contacts from one Android smartphone to another? Glad you asked. Because there are other ways to transfer contacts from an Android smartphone to another that do not use Bluetooth and can be both seamless and more powerful than the Bluetooth method, depending on your tastes and needs.</p><h3 id="II-I-Sync-Contacts-Using-Google-Account"><a href="#II-I-Sync-Contacts-Using-Google-Account" class="headerlink" title="II.I: Sync Contacts Using Google Account"></a>II.I: Sync Contacts Using Google Account</h3><p>This is another method to transfer your contacts on one Android device and restore them on another Android device. Here’s how to transfer contacts from one Android smartphone to another using Google Sync:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings on your old device</p><p>Step 2: Tap Accounts</p><p>Step 3: Tap the account you want to transfer contacts from</p><p>Step 4: Make sure that there is a checkmark next to Contacts, or, in other words, Contacts sync is enabled&#x2F; toggled.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/01/transfer-contacts-android-to-android-9.jpg"                      alt="enable contacts sync in google account settings"                ></p><p>Now, Google will sync your contacts from the Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G device onto the cloud, and your new device signed into the same Google Account will automatically download the contacts.</p><h3 id="II-II-Transfer-Contacts-from-An-Android-Smartphone-To-Another-Using-Manufacturer-Apps"><a href="#II-II-Transfer-Contacts-from-An-Android-Smartphone-To-Another-Using-Manufacturer-Apps" class="headerlink" title="II.II: Transfer Contacts from An Android Smartphone To Another Using Manufacturer Apps"></a>II.II: Transfer Contacts from An Android Smartphone To Another Using Manufacturer Apps</h3><p>Now, if you have an LG phone, you might be more willing to use LG apps than, say, Xiaomi apps. Same for Xiaomi users who would probably scoff at using Samsung apps on their beloved Xiaomi devices. Manufacturers provide apps on Google Play Store that make transferring content from another device to their devices easy because that suits them to make the processes as seamless and easy for their customers. Even Apple is no different in that regard, they have an app to make it easy for people to switch from Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G to iOS.</p><p>There are apps by most major manufacturers like Samsung and Xiaomi, including the older titans such as LG that have now stopped manufacturing phones recently. More or less, the steps that users would need to take to transfer contacts from their old devices to the new are fairly common, and you can use the app for your manufacturers, such as Mi Mover for Xiaomi and Samsung Smart Switch. Here is how to transfer contacts from old Android to new Samsung devices using Samsung Smart Switch.</p><p>Step 1: Download Samsung Smart Switch on both your old Android and the new Samsung device</p><p>Step 2: Keep the Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G devices close by, say, on the table. This will not work if the Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G devices are in different rooms or too far away.</p><p>Step 3: Launch Smart Switch on both the Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G devices</p><p>Step 4: Tap Send Data on old Android</p><p>Step 5: Tap Receive Data on the new Samsung device</p><p>Step 6: Tap Wireless method on both devices</p><p>Step 7: Tap Allow on your old device to start the transfer process. Don’t worry, this will not dump all your content just yet.</p><p>Step 8: On your new Samsung device, choose what you want to transfer - Contacts, in this case.</p><p>Step 9: Tap Transfer and when the transfer is done, tap Close.</p><p>That’s all it takes to transfer contacts from old phone to new using Samsung Smart Switch. The process is fairly similar for all other apps from manufacturers. You tap Send on the old device, tap Receive on the new device, choose what you want to receive, and that’s it.</p><p><strong>Limitations Of App-based Transfer Methods</strong></p><p>It must be noted that there is one binding limitation with such apps - these apps are not two-way streets. You cannot use Samsung Switch to transfer contacts from Samsung phones to another manufacturer’s phones. The same goes for all other manufacturers. All of them allow data into their devices, not out of their devices onto another manufacturer’s devices, using their apps.</p><p>In that regard, using a third-party solution such as Dr.Fone allows you complete freedom to do whatever you want and whenever you want, and even so, Dr.Fone is a great tool to have in one’s arsenal to use every day. How? Because not only does Dr.Fone allow you to transfer contacts from one Android device to another, you have complete freedom to mix the Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G devices in all possible ways. So, if you want to transfer from Samsung to Xiaomi, you can do that. You want to transfer from Xiaomi to Samsung, Dr.Fone does that. Transfer from Apple iPhone to Xiaomi? Yes! Xiaomi or Samsung to Apple iPhone? You bet, all supported! And with a clean, easy-to-use interface that does the job quickly and safely.</p><h3 id="II-III-Transfer-Contacts-from-Oppo-Reno-10-Pro-5G-to-Other-Android-Devices-Using-Dr-Fone-Phone-Transfer"><a href="#II-III-Transfer-Contacts-from-Oppo-Reno-10-Pro-5G-to-Other-Android-Devices-Using-Dr-Fone-Phone-Transfer" class="headerlink" title="II.III: Transfer Contacts from Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G to Other Android Devices Using Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer"></a>II.III: Transfer Contacts from Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G to Other Android Devices Using Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer</h3><h3 id="Video-Tutorial-How-to-Transfer-Data-from-Oppo-Reno-10-Pro-5G-to-Other-Android-Devices"><a href="#Video-Tutorial-How-to-Transfer-Data-from-Oppo-Reno-10-Pro-5G-to-Other-Android-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Video Tutorial: How to Transfer Data from Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G to Other Android Devices"></a>Video Tutorial: How to Transfer Data from Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G to Other Android Devices</h3><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Fhd5Vugoek" id="video-iframe-t"></iframe><p>Now, how about a method that frees you from all limitations and any possible hiccups you might encounter with the previous methods?

One is to transfer contacts from an Android smartphone to another using Bluetooth, which means you can transfer between any smartphone easily and whenever you wish to, without limitations such as which manufacturer the smartphone belongs to. But, how about some more control over what you transfer? If you do not want to use Bluetooth, there is the other way to simply enable Sync in your Google Account, post which your contacts will be uploaded to your Google Account and downloaded to your other device. Or, when you want to do more than transfer, or when you want to have the convenience of doing things from your computer, you have a third way, where you can use Dr.Fone with the Phone Transfer module that lets you select what to transfer, and importantly, lets you transfer between manufacturers easily. So you want to transfer from Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G to iPhone, you can do that. You want to transfer from an Android smartphone to another, you can do that. You want to transfer contacts and other data from one manufacturer to another, you can do that. All in just three steps - connect, select, click.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-restore-wiped-call-history-on-asus-rog-phone-8-pro-by-fonelab-android-recover-call-logs/"><u>How to restore wiped call history on Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/4-ways-to-transfer-music-from-vivo-x100-to-iphone-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>4 Ways to Transfer Music from Vivo X100 to iPhone | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-recover-iphone-12-pro-max-data-from-ios-itunes-backup-drfone-by-drfone-ios-data-recovery-ios-data-recovery/"><u>How to Recover iPhone 12 Pro Max Data From iOS iTunes Backup?

We will also provide a few tutorials on how to <strong>transfer data from Oppo Reno 10 Pro 5G to iPhone 15</strong> conveniently.

It’s not just a simple file-sharing method that can be completed in no time. A lot of things are involved when data is transferred from one device to another. To help you understand it better, below is a list of factors affecting the quality and speed of data migration.</p><h3 id="File-Size"><a href="#File-Size" class="headerlink" title="File Size"></a>File Size</h3><p>The size of files being transferred affects the process in general. This is because the Oppo Reno 10 Pro 5G device on the receiving end needs to allocate the data individually to the available space. That’s why the procedure often takes some time to complete if the volume of files is quite large. On the hand one hand, data migration gets completed in a snap if the file size is smaller.</p><h3 id="File-Type"><a href="#File-Type" class="headerlink" title="File Type"></a>File Type</h3><p>The type of files involved in the data transfer is also a factor. Why so? The simplest explanation is that compatibility matters a lot in any form of file transfer. For instance, the procedure will likely fail if the receiver’s device does not support the data you’re trying to send. But don’t worry. There are lots of methods to transfer data from Oppo Reno 10 Pro 5G to iPhone 15 if your first try doesn’t work out.</p><h3 id="Device-Storage"><a href="#Device-Storage" class="headerlink" title="Device Storage"></a>Device Storage</h3><p>Device storage is definitely the first thing you should check before going ahead with the data transfer. It is important that the receiver’s device has adequate memory to accommodate the incoming files. Otherwise, the transfer will likely not push through.</p><h3 id="Operating-Systems"><a href="#Operating-Systems" class="headerlink" title="Operating Systems"></a>Operating Systems</h3><p>Migrating files between two smartphones with the same operating system is convenient. It’s because these two devices share an identical data-sharing structure. On the one hand, data migration between two smartphones with different operating systems is almost similar to the former. It’s just that the steps for the latter are quite longer. But don’t sweat it. There are many tutorials that can help you transfer data from Oppo Reno 10 Pro 5G to iPhone 15 conveniently.</p><h2 id="5-Various-Ways-to-Transfer-Data-From-Oppo-Reno-10-Pro-5G-to-iPhone-15"><a href="#5-Various-Ways-to-Transfer-Data-From-Oppo-Reno-10-Pro-5G-to-iPhone-15" class="headerlink" title="5 Various Ways to Transfer Data From Oppo Reno 10 Pro 5G to iPhone 15"></a>5 Various Ways to Transfer Data From Oppo Reno 10 Pro 5G to iPhone 15</h2><p>Sharing files between Android and iOS smartphones has become a lot easier today than ever before.

Set the Oppo Reno 10 Pro 5G as the former and the iPhone 15 as the latter. Alternatively, click the <strong>Flip</strong> button to modify the direction of the transfer based on your preference.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/transfer-android-to-ios-1.png"                      alt="source and target"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Select the specific categories of files you want to transfer.

It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.</p><p>NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Oppo K11 5G devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.</p><p>1. On your Oppo K11 5G, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Oppo K11 5G to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings"                ></p><p>This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg"                      alt="Transfer data from Oppo K11 5G to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC"                ></p><p>2. Another method of checking is by opening settings menu and tapping on the search icon. Type in “NFC”. If your phone is capable, it will show up. The NFC function works hand-in-hand with the android beam. NFC may not work at optimal levels if android beam is “off”.</p><p>To Transfer Photos from your Oppo K11 5G to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.</p><p>1. To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.</p><p>2. Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-04.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Oppo K11 5G to Other Android Devices by NFC-Choose Photos"                ></p><p>3. At this stage, both an audio sound and visual message will appear, acting as confirmation that both devices have found each other’s radio waves.</p><p>4. Now, on your Oppo K11 5G, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-05.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Oppo K11 5G to Other Android Devices by NFC-“Touch to beam”"                ></p><p>To begin beaming, you must touch the screen on your Oppo K11 5G from where the photos are been sent. A sound will alert you that beaming has started.</p><p>To ensure a successful transfer, make sure devices are not locked neither should the screen be turned off. Also both devices should be kept back-to-back throughout the duration of the transfer.</p><p>5. Finally, when the beaming is complete, you will hear an audio sound. This is to confirm completion of the process. Alternatively, instead of an audio confirmation, the application on your new android device to which the photos were sent will automatically launch and display the beamed content.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth"><a href="#Part-3-Transfer-Photos-between-Android-Phones-by-Bluetooth" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

If you plan to switch to a new Android device, this article will help you <strong><strong>transfer files from Oppo Find X6 Pro to Other Android Devices</strong></strong>.</p><p>There are multiple ways to transfer files from one Android to another, but we have chosen the easiest 5 methods in this article.

It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.</p><p>NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Oppo Find N3 devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.</p><ul><li>On your Oppo Find N3, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Oppo Find N3 to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings"                ></p><ul><li>This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg"                      alt="Transfer data from Oppo Find N3 to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC"                ></p><ul><li>Another method of checking is by opening the settings menu and tapping on the search icon.

NFC may not work at optimal levels if the android beam is “off”.</li></ul><p>To Transfer Photos from your old android device to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use the Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.</p><p>To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.</p><p>Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-04.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Oppo Find N3 to Other Android Devices by NFC-Choose Photos"                ></p><p>At this stage, both an audio sound and visual message will appear, acting as confirmation that both devices have found each other’s radio waves.</p><p>Now, on your old android device, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-05.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Oppo Find N3 to Other Android Devices by NFC-“Touch to beam”"                ></p><p>To begin beaming, you must touch the screen on your old android device from where the photos are been sent.

The data stored in their old phone is one of the major reasons why people are hesitant to switch devices. However, it is only the case when you don’t know the right method. If you plan to switch to a new Android device, this article will help you <strong><strong>transfer files from Oppo F25 Pro 5G to Other Android Devices</strong></strong>.</p><p>There are multiple ways to transfer files from one Android to another, but we have chosen the easiest 5 methods in this article.

It’s not just a simple file-sharing method that can be completed in no time. A lot of things are involved when data is transferred from one device to another. To help you understand it better, below is a list of factors affecting the quality and speed of data migration.</p><h3 id="File-Size"><a href="#File-Size" class="headerlink" title="File Size"></a>File Size</h3><p>The size of files being transferred affects the process in general. This is because the Oppo F25 Pro 5G device on the receiving end needs to allocate the data individually to the available space. That’s why the procedure often takes some time to complete if the volume of files is quite large. On the hand one hand, data migration gets completed in a snap if the file size is smaller.</p><h3 id="File-Type"><a href="#File-Type" class="headerlink" title="File Type"></a>File Type</h3><p>The type of files involved in the data transfer is also a factor. Why so? The simplest explanation is that compatibility matters a lot in any form of file transfer. For instance, the procedure will likely fail if the receiver’s device does not support the data you’re trying to send. But don’t worry. There are lots of methods to transfer data from Oppo F25 Pro 5G to iPhone 15 if your first try doesn’t work out.</p><h3 id="Device-Storage"><a href="#Device-Storage" class="headerlink" title="Device Storage"></a>Device Storage</h3><p>Device storage is definitely the first thing you should check before going ahead with the data transfer. It is important that the receiver’s device has adequate memory to accommodate the incoming files. Otherwise, the transfer will likely not push through.</p><h3 id="Operating-Systems"><a href="#Operating-Systems" class="headerlink" title="Operating Systems"></a>Operating Systems</h3><p>Migrating files between two smartphones with the same operating system is convenient. It’s because these two devices share an identical data-sharing structure. On the one hand, data migration between two smartphones with different operating systems is almost similar to the former. It’s just that the steps for the latter are quite longer. But don’t sweat it. There are many tutorials that can help you transfer data from Oppo F25 Pro 5G to iPhone 15 conveniently.</p><h2 id="5-Various-Ways-to-Transfer-Data-From-Oppo-F25-Pro-5G-to-iPhone-15"><a href="#5-Various-Ways-to-Transfer-Data-From-Oppo-F25-Pro-5G-to-iPhone-15" class="headerlink" title="5 Various Ways to Transfer Data From Oppo F25 Pro 5G to iPhone 15"></a>5 Various Ways to Transfer Data From Oppo F25 Pro 5G to iPhone 15</h2><p>Sharing files between Android and iOS smartphones has become a lot easier today than ever before.

If you plan to switch to a new Android device, this article will help you <strong><strong>transfer files from Oppo A78 to Other Android Devices</strong></strong>.</p><p>There are multiple ways to transfer files from one Android to another, but we have chosen the easiest 5 methods in this article.

The data stored in their old phone is one of the major reasons why people are hesitant to switch devices. However, it is only the case when you don’t know the right method. If you plan to switch to a new Android device, this article will help you <strong><strong>transfer files from Oppo A38 to Other Android Devices</strong></strong>.</p><p>There are multiple ways to transfer files from one Android to another, but we have chosen the easiest 5 methods in this article.

It can be considered Google’s answer to Apple’s AirDrop, though, unlike AirDrop, it doesn’t require Wi-Fi. This method is available for all Android devices though you should use the latest Android OS for smoother working. Moreover, Bluetooth needs to be enabled to use this method.</p><h3 id="Step-by-Step-Guide-To-Transfer-Files-via-Nearby-Share"><a href="#Step-by-Step-Guide-To-Transfer-Files-via-Nearby-Share" class="headerlink" title="Step-by-Step Guide To Transfer Files via Nearby Share"></a>Step-by-Step Guide To Transfer Files via Nearby Share</h3><p><strong><strong>Step 1:</strong></strong> You will need to activate “Nearby Share” on both devices first. To do that, go to the phone’s “Settings” and access the “Google” settings. Here, tap “Devices and Sharing,” and from the next appearing screen, choose “Nearby Share.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/transfer-files-from-android-to-android-4.jpg"                      alt="choose the nearby share option"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2:</strong></strong> In the “Nearby Share” screen, toggle it on and set device visibility to “Everyone.” Once you activate it on both Android devices, find and select the files you want to transfer on the old Android phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/transfer-files-from-android-to-android-5.jpg"                      alt="enable the nearby share option"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 3:</strong></strong> After selecting the required files, press the “Share” button and select “Nearby Share” from the options.

All you need is a USB cable, and you are set. In this method, you will first copy data from the old phone to the computer and then copy it to the new phone from the computer. It works by default on Windows, but for Mac, you need Android File Transfer.</p><h3 id="Instructions-To-Transfer-Files-by-USB-Cable"><a href="#Instructions-To-Transfer-Files-by-USB-Cable" class="headerlink" title="Instructions To Transfer Files by USB Cable"></a>Instructions To Transfer Files by USB Cable</h3><p><strong><strong>Step 1:</strong></strong> First, connect your old Android phone to your computer using a USB cable. A prompt will appear on your asking for the USB purpose. Here, select “File Transfer&#x2F;Android Auto.” It will give your computer access to the phone data.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/transfer-files-from-android-to-android-7.jpg"                      alt="choose file transfer android auto option"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2:</strong></strong> Now copy all the data you want to transfer to your computer and disconnect the old device.

It allows you to back up all your data on the old device and restore it to the new Android device.
