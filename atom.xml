We will also provide a few tutorials on how to <strong>transfer data from Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate to iPhone 15</strong> conveniently. Continue reading below to learn more.</p><h2 id="Factors-to-Consider-When-Transferring-Data-From-Asus-ROG-Phone-7-Ultimate-to-iPhone"><a href="#Factors-to-Consider-When-Transferring-Data-From-Asus-ROG-Phone-7-Ultimate-to-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Factors to Consider When Transferring Data From Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate to iPhone"></a>Factors to Consider When Transferring Data From Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate to iPhone</h2><p>It’s probably true to say that data migration is a major procedure. It’s not just a simple file-sharing method that can be completed in no time. A lot of things are involved when data is transferred from one device to another. To help you understand it better, below is a list of factors affecting the quality and speed of data migration.</p><h3 id="File-Size"><a href="#File-Size" class="headerlink" title="File Size"></a>File Size</h3><p>The size of files being transferred affects the process in general. This is because the Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate device on the receiving end needs to allocate the data individually to the available space. That’s why the procedure often takes some time to complete if the volume of files is quite large. On the hand one hand, data migration gets completed in a snap if the file size is smaller.</p><h3 id="File-Type"><a href="#File-Type" class="headerlink" title="File Type"></a>File Type</h3><p>The type of files involved in the data transfer is also a factor. Why so? The simplest explanation is that compatibility matters a lot in any form of file transfer. For instance, the procedure will likely fail if the receiver’s device does not support the data you’re trying to send. But don’t worry. There are lots of methods to transfer data from Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate to iPhone 15 if your first try doesn’t work out.</p><h3 id="Device-Storage"><a href="#Device-Storage" class="headerlink" title="Device Storage"></a>Device Storage</h3><p>Device storage is definitely the first thing you should check before going ahead with the data transfer. It is important that the receiver’s device has adequate memory to accommodate the incoming files. Otherwise, the transfer will likely not push through.</p><h3 id="Operating-Systems"><a href="#Operating-Systems" class="headerlink" title="Operating Systems"></a>Operating Systems</h3><p>Migrating files between two smartphones with the same operating system is convenient. It’s because these two devices share an identical data-sharing structure. On the one hand, data migration between two smartphones with different operating systems is almost similar to the former. It’s just that the steps for the latter are quite longer. But don’t sweat it. There are many tutorials that can help you transfer data from Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate to iPhone 15 conveniently.</p><h2 id="5-Various-Ways-to-Transfer-Data-From-Asus-ROG-Phone-7-Ultimate-to-iPhone-15"><a href="#5-Various-Ways-to-Transfer-Data-From-Asus-ROG-Phone-7-Ultimate-to-iPhone-15" class="headerlink" title="5 Various Ways to Transfer Data From Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate to iPhone 15"></a>5 Various Ways to Transfer Data From Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate to iPhone 15</h2><p>Sharing files between Android and iOS smartphones has become a lot easier today than ever before. In fact, you can actually complete the entire process in just a matter of minutes. No need for any advanced intervention or external assistance. Just initiate the specific technique that perfectly matches your circumstances.

This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.</p><p>NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Honor X7b devices, most tines on the battery pack.

Now, select “Contact” on your old device and tap “Send”.</p><p>6. You should see a prompt on your new device which asks you to confirm the “receive” of the contact. Tap on “Receive” and all the contacts from your old device will be copied to your new Android device in few minutes.</p><p>Advantages: The process is very fast and can transfer all the contacts at once.</p><p>Disadvantages: This app is not supported on all the Android devices.  Also, the process is lengthy and needs some technical knowledge.</p><p>Thus, these were the four best options that you can use to transfer contacts from Honor X7b to Other Android Devices. However, in our experience, the first method, the Dr.Fone toolkit- Android data backup and restore is by far the best and most secured among all solutions for transferring contacts from Honor X7b to Other Android Devices. So, if you do not want to lose any data while transfer or worry about the security, use the Dr.Fone toolkit for the best result.</p><h2 id="Best-3-Software-to-Transfer-Files-to-from-Your-Honor-X7b-via-a-USB-Cable"><a href="#Best-3-Software-to-Transfer-Files-to-from-Your-Honor-X7b-via-a-USB-Cable" class="headerlink" title="Best 3 Software to Transfer Files to&#x2F;from Your Honor X7b via a USB Cable"></a>Best 3 Software to Transfer Files to&#x2F;from Your Honor X7b via a USB Cable</h2><p>If you are worried about deleting important information from your Honor X7b, you may wish to simply transfer it up to your computer to keep it.

Upon opening it, you will be prompted to connect your Honor X7b with a USB cable or over WiFi, and then once connected, you will be asked permission to install the app on your Honor X7b as well.</p><p>Once connected, you will be brought to this home page, notice the options to use different devices as well as connected through Wi-Fi.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/03/mobogenie-home.jpg"                      alt="USB android file transfer"                ></p><p>As with Mobogenie, once you are on the software, it is fairly easy to navigate around, and you can do everything from sending SMS from your PC to transferring apps and contacts. However, a drawback is that the management of your music requires you to have all your MP3 files on your PC and move them on to the software- not extremely inconvenient, but as we will see much easier solutions exist.</p><p>We recommend the use of Wondershare Dr.Fone, as it is more reliable and provides a simple user-friendly interface that allows you to manage your Honor X7b with ease. You can also transfer files between Android and Mac easily.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-restore-missing-photos-files-from-x6-by-fonelab-android-recover-photos/"><u>How To  Restore Missing Photos Files from X6.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-recover-iphone-6s-plus-data-from-ios-itunes-drfone-by-drfone-ios-data-recovery-ios-data-recovery/"><u>How to Recover iPhone 6s Plus Data From iOS iTunes? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-recover-deleted-photos-on-11x-5g-by-stellar-photo-recovery-android-mobile-photo-recover/"><u>How to recover deleted photos on 11X 5G</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-downgrade-iphone-13-to-an-older-ios-version-drfone-by-drfone-ios-system-repair-ios-system-repair/"><u>How to Downgrade iPhone 13 to an Older iOS Version? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-data-from-iphone-11-pro-to-other-iphone-14-pro-devices-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-data-from-ios-transfer-data-from-ios/"><u>How To Transfer Data From iPhone 11 Pro To Other iPhone 14 Pro devices? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/5-easy-ways-to-copy-contacts-from-honor-100-pro-to-iphone-14-and-15-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>5 Easy Ways to Copy Contacts from Honor 100 Pro to iPhone 14 and 15 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-retrieve-deleted-photos-on-huawei-nova-y91-by-stellar-photo-recovery-android-mobile-photo-recover/"><u>How to Retrieve deleted photos on Huawei Nova Y91</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/webpage-wonders-enhancing-with-youtubes-playlist-features-for-2024/"><u>Webpage Wonders  Enhancing with YouTube's Playlist Features for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-comparing-streams-vimeo-versus-youtube/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Comparing Streams  Vimeo Versus YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/updated-mastering-powerpoints-voice-recognition-feature/"><u>[Updated] Mastering PowerPoint's Voice Recognition Feature</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/new-prime-psd-visual-enhancements/"><u>[New] Prime PSD Visual Enhancements</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-revolutionizing-home-cinema-latest-on-samsungs-ubd-k850u/"><u>In 2024, Revolutionizing Home Cinema  Latest on Samsung’s UBD-K850U</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-ultimate-checklist-for-successful-reddit-threads/"><u>2024 Approved  The Ultimate Checklist for Successful Reddit Threads</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-boosting-tiktok-traffic-the-ultimate-list-of-engaging-usernames-for-2024/"><u>[New] Boosting TikTok Traffic  The Ultimate List of Engaging Usernames for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/updated-navigating-the-future-vrs-role-in-business-strategy/"><u>[Updated] Navigating the Future  VR's Role in Business Strategy</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-remove-screen-lock-pin-on-tecno-spark-20-like-a-pro-5-easy-ways-by-drfone-android/"><u>How To Remove Screen Lock PIN On Tecno Spark 20 Like A Pro 5 Easy Ways</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

For your device, make sure that the PIN is the same on both devices to ensure the security of the connection. This PIN is generated afresh and is unique, so the PIN in the image is not the PIN you will see on your devices. Tap Pair on your old device to pair the two devices together using Bluetooth.</p><p>Step 6: After pairing is complete, both devices will show under paired devices on each other:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/01/transfer-contacts-android-to-android-3.jpg"                      alt="old device showing paired android"                ></p><p>And that’s how simple it is to pair devices to each other using Bluetooth!</p><h3 id="I-II-Transfer-Contacts-from-One-Android-Smartphone-to-Another-Using-Bluetooth"><a href="#I-II-Transfer-Contacts-from-One-Android-Smartphone-to-Another-Using-Bluetooth" class="headerlink" title="I.II: Transfer Contacts from One Android Smartphone to Another Using Bluetooth"></a>I.II: Transfer Contacts from One Android Smartphone to Another Using Bluetooth</h3><p>Here is how to transfer contacts from one Android to another, easily, using Bluetooth:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Phone on your old phone and select the Contacts tab</p><p>Step 2: Tap the vertical ellipses and select Import&#x2F; Export.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/01/transfer-contacts-android-to-android-4.jpg"                      alt="export contacts from old android to new"                ></p><p>This particular option can vary by your phone model and Android flavor, this is on Android 7 running on Motorola G4 Play.

Same for Xiaomi users who would probably scoff at using Samsung apps on their beloved Xiaomi devices. Manufacturers provide apps on Google Play Store that make transferring content from another device to their devices easy because that suits them to make the processes as seamless and easy for their customers. Even Apple is no different in that regard, they have an app to make it easy for people to switch from Honor Magic V2 to iOS.</p><p>There are apps by most major manufacturers like Samsung and Xiaomi, including the older titans such as LG that have now stopped manufacturing phones recently. More or less, the steps that users would need to take to transfer contacts from their old devices to the new are fairly common, and you can use the app for your manufacturers, such as Mi Mover for Xiaomi and Samsung Smart Switch. Here is how to transfer contacts from old Android to new Samsung devices using Samsung Smart Switch.</p><p>Step 1: Download Samsung Smart Switch on both your old Android and the new Samsung device</p><p>Step 2: Keep the Honor Magic V2 devices close by, say, on the table. This will not work if the Honor Magic V2 devices are in different rooms or too far away.</p><p>Step 3: Launch Smart Switch on both the Honor Magic V2 devices</p><p>Step 4: Tap Send Data on old Android</p><p>Step 5: Tap Receive Data on the new Samsung device</p><p>Step 6: Tap Wireless method on both devices</p><p>Step 7: Tap Allow on your old device to start the transfer process. Don’t worry, this will not dump all your content just yet.</p><p>Step 8: On your new Samsung device, choose what you want to transfer - Contacts, in this case.</p><p>Step 9: Tap Transfer and when the transfer is done, tap Close.</p><p>That’s all it takes to transfer contacts from old phone to new using Samsung Smart Switch. The process is fairly similar for all other apps from manufacturers. You tap Send on the old device, tap Receive on the new device, choose what you want to receive, and that’s it.</p><p><strong>Limitations Of App-based Transfer Methods</strong></p><p>It must be noted that there is one binding limitation with such apps - these apps are not two-way streets. You cannot use Samsung Switch to transfer contacts from Samsung phones to another manufacturer’s phones. The same goes for all other manufacturers. All of them allow data into their devices, not out of their devices onto another manufacturer’s devices, using their apps.</p><p>In that regard, using a third-party solution such as Dr.Fone allows you complete freedom to do whatever you want and whenever you want, and even so, Dr.Fone is a great tool to have in one’s arsenal to use every day. How? Because not only does Dr.Fone allow you to transfer contacts from one Android device to another, you have complete freedom to mix the Honor Magic V2 devices in all possible ways. So, if you want to transfer from Samsung to Xiaomi, you can do that. You want to transfer from Xiaomi to Samsung, Dr.Fone does that. Transfer from Apple iPhone to Xiaomi? Yes! Xiaomi or Samsung to Apple iPhone? You bet, all supported! And with a clean, easy-to-use interface that does the job quickly and safely.</p><h3 id="II-III-Transfer-Contacts-from-Honor-Magic-V2-to-Other-Android-Devices-Using-Dr-Fone-Phone-Transfer"><a href="#II-III-Transfer-Contacts-from-Honor-Magic-V2-to-Other-Android-Devices-Using-Dr-Fone-Phone-Transfer" class="headerlink" title="II.III: Transfer Contacts from Honor Magic V2 to Other Android Devices Using Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer"></a>II.III: Transfer Contacts from Honor Magic V2 to Other Android Devices Using Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer</h3><h3 id="Video-Tutorial-How-to-Transfer-Data-from-Honor-Magic-V2-to-Other-Android-Devices"><a href="#Video-Tutorial-How-to-Transfer-Data-from-Honor-Magic-V2-to-Other-Android-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Video Tutorial: How to Transfer Data from Honor Magic V2 to Other Android Devices"></a>Video Tutorial: How to Transfer Data from Honor Magic V2 to Other Android Devices</h3><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Fhd5Vugoek" id="video-iframe-t"></iframe><p>Now, how about a method that frees you from all limitations and any possible hiccups you might encounter with the previous methods?

One is to transfer contacts from an Android smartphone to another using Bluetooth, which means you can transfer between any smartphone easily and whenever you wish to, without limitations such as which manufacturer the smartphone belongs to. But, how about some more control over what you transfer? If you do not want to use Bluetooth, there is the other way to simply enable Sync in your Google Account, post which your contacts will be uploaded to your Google Account and downloaded to your other device. Or, when you want to do more than transfer, or when you want to have the convenience of doing things from your computer, you have a third way, where you can use Dr.Fone with the Phone Transfer module that lets you select what to transfer, and importantly, lets you transfer between manufacturers easily. So you want to transfer from Honor Magic V2 to iPhone, you can do that. You want to transfer from an Android smartphone to another, you can do that. You want to transfer contacts and other data from one manufacturer to another, you can do that. All in just three steps - connect, select, click.</p><h2 id="How-to-Transfer-Photos-from-Honor-Magic-V2-to-Laptop-Without-USB"><a href="#How-to-Transfer-Photos-from-Honor-Magic-V2-to-Laptop-Without-USB" class="headerlink" title="How to Transfer Photos from Honor Magic V2 to Laptop Without USB"></a>How to Transfer Photos from Honor Magic V2 to Laptop Without USB</h2><p>Moving your photos on a computer comes with lots of benefits.

It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.</p><p>NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Honor 90 Pro devices, most tines on the battery pack. But since most android devices don’t have a removable back, there is an alternative to checking if your device is NFC enabled.</p><ul><li>On your Honor 90 Pro, tap on “Settings” and click on “More” located under “Wireless and Networks” .</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-02.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Honor 90 Pro to Other Android Devices by NFC-Go to Settings"                ></p><ul><li>This would take you to a screen where you should find the NFC and android beam options as depicted in the image below. At this stage enable both options if any or both have been disabled. If the NFC option doesn’t appear, it then means your device does not have Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-03.jpg"                      alt="Transfer data from Honor 90 Pro to Other Android Devices by NFC-enable NFC"                ></p><ul><li>Another method of checking is by opening the settings menu and tapping on the search icon.

NFC may not work at optimal levels if the android beam is “off”.</li></ul><p>To Transfer Photos from your old android device to a new android device, ensure both devices support NFC using the method explained above. Once this is confirmed, use the Android beam to access the photos you want to transfer to your new android device.</p><p>To select multiple photos, long press on a photo. Then choose the photos you want to transfer to new android device. When you are done selecting, you can begin the beaming process.</p><p>Next, place both devices against each other, back to back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-04.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Honor 90 Pro to Other Android Devices by NFC-Choose Photos"                ></p><p>At this stage, both an audio sound and visual message will appear, acting as confirmation that both devices have found each other’s radio waves.</p><p>Now, on your old android device, the screen will reduce to a thumbnail and a “Touch to beam” message will pop up at the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/transfer-old-android-to-new-android-by-nfc-05.jpg"                      alt="Transfer Photos from Honor 90 Pro to Other Android Devices by NFC-“Touch to beam”"                ></p><p>To begin beaming, you must touch the screen on your old android device from where the photos are been sent.

So, if you do not want to lose any data while transfer or worry about the security, use the Dr.Fone toolkit for the best result.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-rescue-lost-contacts-from-vivo-y78t-by-fonelab-android-recover-contacts/"><u>How to Rescue Lost Contacts from Vivo Y78t?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/5-easy-ways-to-copy-contacts-from-huawei-p60-to-iphone-14-and-15-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>5 Easy Ways to Copy Contacts from Huawei P60 to iPhone 14 and 15 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-identify-missing-your-hardware-drivers-with-windows-device-manager-on-windows-11107-by-drivereasy-guide/"><u>How to identify missing your hardware drivers with Windows Device Manager on Windows 11/10/7</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/5-ways-to-move-contacts-from-honor-play-40c-to-iphone-131415-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>5 Ways to Move Contacts From Honor Play 40C to iPhone (13/14/15) | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-remove-iphone-6-plus-face-id-by-drfone-ios-unlock-ios-unlock/"><u>How to Remove iPhone 6 Plus Face ID?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-retrieve-erased-call-logs-from-samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-by-fonelab-android-recover-call-logs/"><u>How to retrieve erased call logs from Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-recover-deleted-photos-from-tecno-spark-20c-by-fonelab-android-recover-photos/"><u>How to recover deleted photos from Tecno Spark 20C.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/2-ways-to-transfer-text-messages-from-infinix-zero-5g-2023-turbo-to-iphone-1514131211x8-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>2 Ways to Transfer Text Messages from Infinix Zero 5G 2023 Turbo to iPhone 15/14/13/12/11/X/8/ | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location.techidaily.com/fake-android-location-without-rooting-for-your-vivo-s17t-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/"><u>Fake Android Location without Rooting For Your Vivo S17t | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-do-you-remove-restricted-mode-on-apple-iphone-8-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How Do You Remove Restricted Mode on Apple iPhone 8 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/crafting-breathtaking-image-mosaics-step-by-step/"><u>Crafting Breathtaking Image Mosaics Step-by-Step</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/get-to-know-discord-inside-out-for-2024/"><u>Get to Know Discord Inside Out for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-cut-to-the-chase-quick-background-blur-tricks-for-everyday-meets/"><u>2024 Approved  Cut to the Chase  Quick Background Blur Tricks for Everyday Meets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-apps.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-quickclip-editor/"><u>New In 2024, QuickClip Editor</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/15-best-sites-to-find-and-download-royalty-free-music-for-youtube/"><u>15 Best Sites to Find & Download Royalty-Free Music for YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-creation-software.techidaily.com/in-2024-smart-video-editing-tools-with-one-click-reframe/"><u>In 2024, Smart Video Editing Tools with One-Click Reframe</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-master-the-mix-incorporating-and-refining-music-into-canva-projects/"><u>In 2024, Master the Mix  Incorporating & Refining Music Into Canva Projects</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Make sure it is switched on. Also, ensure that the phone’s Bluetooth visibility is enabled so that your device can be seen and easily paired with the other device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-music-from-android-to-android-8.jpg"                      alt="transfer music from android to android-Go to “Connection”"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Now, switch on the Bluetooth for the destination device as well.

Click OK to pair both devices successfully.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-music-from-android-to-android-9.jpg"                      alt="transfer music from android to android-pair both devices"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> The final step is to head to the File Manager app on your phone or go to your Music Player, select the music file you wish to transfer, and then click on your device’s Share button or logo.</p><p>Here, scroll until you see the “Bluetooth” option. You will be immediately prompted to select the Honor Play 8T device to share with, click the earlier paired device name, and then click on “Accept” on the other device.</p><p>This is how you can transfer music files from Honor Play 8T to Other Android Devices using Bluetooth.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-music-from-android-to-android-10.jpg"                      alt="transfer music from android to android-use Bluetooth"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-transfer-music-from-Honor-Play-8T-to-Other-Android-Devices-using-NFC"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-transfer-music-from-Honor-Play-8T-to-Other-Android-Devices-using-NFC" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. How to transfer music from Honor Play 8T to Other Android Devices using NFC?"></a>Part 4. How to transfer music from Honor Play 8T to Other Android Devices using NFC?</h2><p>NFC or Near Field Communication is another wireless means to transfer music from Honor Play 8T to Other Android Devices. Although, unlike Bluetooth, this method requires contact between the two devices making the transfer.</p><p><strong>Below are the steps on how to transfer music from Honor Play 8T to Other Android Devices using NFC.</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> First, enable NFC connection on both the Honor Play 8T devices between which you want to transfer the music files. To switch on NFC on Android, go to Phone’s “Settings” and click on “More Settings” under “Wireless and Network” options. Now click on the NFC button to ensure that it is switched On.

It’s not just a simple file-sharing method that can be completed in no time. A lot of things are involved when data is transferred from one device to another. To help you understand it better, below is a list of factors affecting the quality and speed of data migration.</p><h3 id="File-Size"><a href="#File-Size" class="headerlink" title="File Size"></a>File Size</h3><p>The size of files being transferred affects the process in general. This is because the Xiaomi Redmi K70E device on the receiving end needs to allocate the data individually to the available space. That’s why the procedure often takes some time to complete if the volume of files is quite large. On the hand one hand, data migration gets completed in a snap if the file size is smaller.</p><h3 id="File-Type"><a href="#File-Type" class="headerlink" title="File Type"></a>File Type</h3><p>The type of files involved in the data transfer is also a factor. Why so? The simplest explanation is that compatibility matters a lot in any form of file transfer. For instance, the procedure will likely fail if the receiver’s device does not support the data you’re trying to send. But don’t worry. There are lots of methods to transfer data from Xiaomi Redmi K70E to iPhone 15 if your first try doesn’t work out.</p><h3 id="Device-Storage"><a href="#Device-Storage" class="headerlink" title="Device Storage"></a>Device Storage</h3><p>Device storage is definitely the first thing you should check before going ahead with the data transfer. It is important that the receiver’s device has adequate memory to accommodate the incoming files. Otherwise, the transfer will likely not push through.</p><h3 id="Operating-Systems"><a href="#Operating-Systems" class="headerlink" title="Operating Systems"></a>Operating Systems</h3><p>Migrating files between two smartphones with the same operating system is convenient. It’s because these two devices share an identical data-sharing structure. On the one hand, data migration between two smartphones with different operating systems is almost similar to the former. It’s just that the steps for the latter are quite longer. But don’t sweat it. There are many tutorials that can help you transfer data from Xiaomi Redmi K70E to iPhone 15 conveniently.</p><h2 id="5-Various-Ways-to-Transfer-Data-From-Xiaomi-Redmi-K70E-to-iPhone-15"><a href="#5-Various-Ways-to-Transfer-Data-From-Xiaomi-Redmi-K70E-to-iPhone-15" class="headerlink" title="5 Various Ways to Transfer Data From Xiaomi Redmi K70E to iPhone 15"></a>5 Various Ways to Transfer Data From Xiaomi Redmi K70E to iPhone 15</h2><p>Sharing files between Android and iOS smartphones has become a lot easier today than ever before.

It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.</p><p>NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Vivo Y78+ (T1) Edition devices, most tines on the battery pack.

It is a fast and simple program that requires both devices to NFC-capable. This means they are able to communicate with each other when their fields are near. This communication is made possible through radio frequencies. Most devices have NFC hardware integrated underneath their panel.</p><p>NFC can be found in almost every android device. In the past, it was easy to identify devices with NFC as such devices usually had NFC printed somewhere in the back of the Honor X50 devices, most tines on the battery pack.
